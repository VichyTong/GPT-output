Add 50μl Beads to 50μl of the PCR sample. Mix thoroughly, then incubate it at RT for 15min. Place this PCR sample on a magnetic stand at RT for 5min. Remove and discard the supernatant using a 200μl pipette. Add 200μl fresh 80% EtOH, incubate at RT for 30s, remove and discard the supernatant. Add 200μl fresh 80% EtOH again to complete the washing, incubate at RT for 30s, remove and discard the supernatant. Let the sample dry at RT for ~5-10min. Place the sample with the Beads away from the magnetic stand, then add 22.5μl Resuspension Buffer to the Beads. Mix thoroughly and incubate at RT for 2min. Place the sample on the magnetic stand at RT for 5min again. Finally, transfer 20μl of the supernatant into a new PCR well; it is the library. Store it at -20℃, up to two months. Go on to qualify and quantify it for pair-end sequencing on Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform."
