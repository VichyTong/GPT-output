    "Take steps to prevent DNA shearing \\(as the first step of the protocol involves shearing the DNA using sonication).",
    "We routinely use a protocol \\(4) that combines chemical, physical, and enzymatic lysis steps to maximize the representation of various community members \\(keeping in mind that unlysed cells will not release DNA into the solution and hence will not be represented in the final community profile).",

    "Determine DNA concentration using the Qubit fluorometer \\(BR kit, one replicate to preserve sample).",
    "We typically ",

    "Although the protocol stipulates that the reaction should be purified using Qiaquick columns, we have found that this can result in the co-purification of small DNA fragments that are anticipated to interfere with subsequent sequencing \\(Figure 4A).",
