    "1) _S. aureus_ strains carrying the plasmid pTet15 \\(control) or pTet15-FabF were inoculated from frozen cultures into 25 mls",
    "Miller&#x2019;s LB containing 34 &#xB5;g/ml chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37&#xB0;C with shaking \\(220 rpm). ",
    "2) Cultures were diluted in LB to a final OD 600 of 2.",
    "For each strain, one ml of diluted culture was added to 25 mls  LB/1.2% ",
    "Select agar \\(autoclaved and cooled to 50&#xB0;C) containing 15 &#xB5;g/ml chloramphenicol and 45 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline, poured into an OmniTray with a 96-well pin lid, and allowed to solidify at room temperature. ",
    "3) After solidification, pin lids were removed and 10 &#xB5;l of various concentrations of platensimycin in DMSO was added to wells on both the control and FabF over expressing plates.",
    "4) Plates were incubated overnight at 37&#xB0;C and imaged."
