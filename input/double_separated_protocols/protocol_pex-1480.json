    "This study is a prospective, Delphi consensus-seeking exercise, mixed, iterative survey of internal and external experts, patients and other stakeholders.",

    "We will therefore aim to have a diverse sample of healthcare workers with expertise in clinical care, quality improvement and/or research.",
    "Eventually, the Guideline Development Group and other WHO panels might be invited to participate, as well as individual experts and patient representatives, with an emphasis to enrich female, young and/or those in LMIC panelists.",

    "The Delphi method is a structured communication technique originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts.<a href=\"#_edn1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[4,5]</a>.",
    "Essentially, a Delphi ",
    "Process is one in which a panel of experts answers a series of questionnaires over two or more rounds in an attempt to achieve consensus.",
    "The technique can also be adapted for use in face-to-face meetings (termed \u201cmini-Delphi\u201d or Estimate-Talk-Estimate (ETE)).",
    "Delphi has been widely used for research and has certain advantages over another structured forecasting approaches.<a href=\"#_edn3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[6]</a> Delphi is based on the principle that forecasts (or decisions) from a structured group of individuals are more accurate than those from unstructured groups.",
    "The panelists answer questionnaires in two or more rounds.",

    "Change agent provides an anonymized summary of the panelists\u2019 forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments.",
    "Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of their panel.",
    "It is believed that during this ",
    "Process the range of answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the \"best\" answer.",
    "Finally, the ",
    "Process is stopped after a predefined stop criterion (e.g., number of rounds, achievement of consensus, stability of results), and the mean or median scores of the final rounds ",
    "Determine the results.<a href=\"#_edn4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[7]</a> Special attention is paid to the formulation of the Delphi theses and the definition and selection of the panelists in order to avoid methodological weaknesses that could threaten the validity and reliability of the results.[8<a href=\"#_edn5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">]</a> For this Delphi task, the COMET software will bus used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMET</p><p><br></p><p>COMET Initiative DelphiManager is a web-based system designed to facilitate the building and management of Delphi surveys.",
    "<a href=\"#_edn6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[9]</a> From a simple Excel template, COMET creates a multi-round Delphi survey using the Setup Wizard.",
    "Panelists will rate each question using a 1-9 Likert scale with an \u201cUnable to rate\u201d option, should they feel that item is beyond their expertise.",
    "In order to avoid a participant selecting the \u201cUnable to rate\u201d column accidentally, it is colored differently by default.",
    "An example of what a participant might be shown in round 2 (of a Delphi with a single panel throughout) is given in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.",
