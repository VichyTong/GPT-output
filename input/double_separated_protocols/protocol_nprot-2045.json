    "Put up the occluder and placed the designated number of food items \\(raisins or peanuts) underneath the two plates.",

    "In these trials raisins lay on top of the plates as well as underneath.",
    "The baboons performed equally in these trials and in the rest of these sessions.",
    "However, to exclude any inferences from using different food kinds as choice stimuli and reward, we always used the same kind of food as choice stimuli and reward for the macaques, thus peanuts and peanuts or raisins and raisins depending on the food preferences of each subject. ",
    "After the completion of each test condition the subjects went through a new familiarization phase to show them the paradigm for the next condition \\(i.e.",
    "Food, Pebbles or Food replaced).",

    "In these experiments, we used tow small boxes with a lid that opened to one side.",
    "Inside theses boxes were small drawers to ",
    "Deposit the corresponding amount of food pieces.",
    "The boxes were baited by a second experimenter.",
    "As we used the same paradigm as in the 'Pebbles' condition the second experimenter placed  the designated number of food items inside the drawers and the same amount of pebbles onto it so that the first experimenter did not know how many pebbles respectively food items were in each box.",
    "The first experimenter  then presented the boxes to the subjects using the same procedure as in the former testing conditions.",

    "Controlling for changes in associative strength.\r\n  ",
    "Because it was suggested that the difference in performance might be due to the fact that in the Food condition, the choice stimuli had lesser associative strength because they changed in appearance while the items were fed to the monkeys, we ran a further set of control experiments with 8 macaques.",
    "In the first control condition, all food items lying on the plates were taken away after the subjects had made their choice \\(\u2018Food away\u2019), and then given to the monkeys while hidden in the experimenter\u2019s palm.",
    "In the second control condition \\(\u2018Pebbles away\u2019), we used pebbles as choice stimuli.",
    "After the subject made its choice, a pebble was removed each time when one of the food items underneath the ",
    "Plate was given to the monkey.",
