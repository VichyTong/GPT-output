    "**Fabrication of the MHN**",
    "The MHN was fabricated on a printed circuit board \\(PCB).",
    "The synapse consists of a memristor, a resistor, an inverter and a transmission gate.",
    "Positive or negative synaptic weight can be obtained by electronic switches.",
    "In the 3-bit MHN, a neuron consists of three synapses.",
    "A neuron was constructed with an operational amplifier to ",
    "Obtain the sum of the three inputs.",
    "The state of the neuron was stored on a capacitor.",
    "The fabrication procedure of the MHN is as follows: ",
    "Design of the schematic circuit of the MHN; ",
    "See \"Figure 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3655/original/Figure_1.jpg?1432391113 ); assembly of the commercial chips, resistors and capacitors, onto the PCB; wire connection of the memristors with the PCB; and programming of the FPGA to control the MHN. ",
    "**TIP**: There are two possible circuit configurations for the synaptic connection, as shown in \"Figure 2\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3657/original/Figure_2.jpg?1432391117.",
    "In the first configuration \\(Figure 2\\(a)), the synaptic weight of the synapse corresponding to in",
    "Put _",
    "N",
    "<sub>i</sub>_ \\(_i_=1, 2, 3) is _w<sub>i</sub>_=\u00b1 _",
    "R_ /\\(_M",
    "<sub>i</sub>_",
    "+",
    "_R_), where _M<sub>i</sub>_ is the resistance of the corresponding memristor.",
    "In this design, _R_ should be of a high resistance at the level of 10<sup>6</sup> ohms in order to limit the current and avoid wrongly-switching of the memristor during circuit operation.",
    "_",
    "M<sub>i</sub>_ can only be adjusted in the range from several tens of ohms to several hundreds of k\u2126 due to the memristor inherent property.",
    "As _R_ is much larger than _M<sub>i</sub>_, _w<sub>i</sub>_ would be insensitive to _M<sub>i</sub>_ and may always stay at \u00b11.",
    "Thus the variable range of the synaptic weight is very small.",
    "It is difficult for the MHN to detect such a small ",
    "Change in _w<sub>i</sub>_.",
    "In contrast, in the second configuration \\(Figure 2\\(b)), _w<sub>i</sub>_=\u00b1 _",
    "M<sub>i</sub>_/\\(_M<sub>i</sub>_",
    "+",
    "_R_), thus the synaptic weight _w<sub>i</sub>_ is much more sensitive to the ",
    "Change of _M<sub>i</sub>_ and can be varied in a larger range.",
    "Therefore, the circuit configuration shown in Figure 2\\(b) is used to implement the synapses. ",
    "**Implementation of associative memory in the MHN**",
    "With a given pattern, the synaptic weight matrix elements in equation \\(1) \\(all equations in this protocol are placed in the \"Supplementary document 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3659/original/Supplementary_equation_file.pdf?1432386669) are set to _w_<sub>11</sub>= _w_<sub>22</sub>= _w_<sub>33</sub>=0, _w_<sub>12</sub>= _w_<sub>21</sub>, _w_<sub>13</sub>= _w_<sub>31</sub>, and _w_<sub>23</sub>= _w_<sub>32</sub>.",
    "The thres",
    "Hold vector **T**=\\(_\u03b8_<sub>1</sub> _\u03b8_<sub>2</sub> _\u03b8_<sub>3</sub>) is set as _\u03b8_<sub>1</sub>= _",
    "\u03b8_<sub>2</sub>= _\u03b8_<sub>3</sub>= _\u03b8_.",
    "Here, _w<sub>ij</sub>_ \\(_i_, _j_=1, 2, 3) is in the form of equation \\(2).",
    "During the recalling process, the MHN is updated according to equation \\(3).",
    "In equation \\(3), _t_ denotes the number of updating cycles; _t_=0 denotes no updating taking ",
    "Place and the corresponding state vector is the initial vector **X**\\(0); and the sign function is defined in equation \\(4).",
    "In one updating cycle, new states of the neurons are asynchronously updated from _x_<sub>1</sub>, _x_<sub>2</sub> to _x_<sub>3</sub> in three stages, which are defined as stages a, b and c, respectively. ",
    "**Single associative memory**",
    "It is required that if the in",
    "Put is the target pattern itself, the final out",
    "Thus, when \u201c110\u201d is stored into the MHN, according to equation \\(3) and Hopfield network rule for updating, equation \\(5) should be satisfied.",
    "With _w_<sub>11</sub>= _w_<sub>22</sub>= _w_<sub>33</sub>=0, _w_<sub>12</sub>= _w_<sub>21</sub>, _w_<sub>13</sub>= _w_<sub>31</sub>, and _w_<sub>23</sub>= _w_<sub>32</sub> and _\u03b8_<sub>1</sub>= _\u03b8_<sub>2</sub>= _\u03b8_<sub>3</sub>= _\u03b8_, equation \\(5) is simplified as shown in equation \\(6).",
    "Equation \\(6) can be satisfied with the following setting: _\u03b8_=-2/60, _w_<sub>12</sub>=4/60, _w_<sub>13</sub>=1/60, and _w_<sub>23</sub>=-4/60.",
    "Thus the synaptic weight matrix is given by equation \\(7), and the thres",
    "Hold vector is given by equation \\(8).",
    "The following initial states **X**\\(0) along with equations \\(7) and \\(8) are ",
    "Put into equation \\(3) to verify the convergence: \u201c000\u201d, \u201c001\u201d, \u201c010\u201d, \u201c011\u201d, \u201c100\u201d, \u201c101\u201d, \u201c110\u201d, and \u201c111\u201d.",
    "It is found that the MHN can eventually converge to the final state \u201c110\u201d from the above initial states. ",
    "Here, **X**\\(0)= \\(_x_\\(0)<sub>1</sub> _x_\\(0)<sub>2</sub> _x_\\(0)<sub>3</sub>)=\\(0 0 0) is taken as an example to demonstrate the recalling process.",
    "In stage a of the first updating cycle, we ",
    "Obtain equation \\(9) according to equation \\(3).",
    "And only _x_<sub>1</sub> is updated in stage a of the first updating cycle, and thus we eventually ",
    "Obtain equation \\(10) in this stage; In stage b of the first updating cycle, equation \\(11) can be obtained according to equation \\(3).",
    "And only _x_<sub>2</sub> is updated in stage b, so we eventually ",
    "Obtain equation \\(12) in this stage; In stage c of the first updating cycle, equation \\(13) can be obtained according to equation \\(3).",
    "And only _x_<sub>3</sub> is updated in stage c, and thus we eventually ",
    "Obtain equation \\(14).",
    "From equations \\(9)-\\(14), we can ",
    "See that \u201c000\u201d eventually converges to \u201c110\u201d.",
    "In a similar way, the MHN converges to \u201c110\u201d from any other initial states. ",
    "With the synaptic weight matrix shown in equation \\(7), the resistance matrix of the memristors determined from equation \\(2) can be set to the form of equation \\(15).",
    "Note that it is not necessary to ",
    "Adjust the resistances of the memristors exactly to the above values because the MHN has a tolerance to the resistance variation.  ",
    "An offline training scheme for setting the resistance of the memristors to a pre-determined value is implemented with a C Language program embedded in the Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system.",
    "With the actual resistance matrix **M** in equation \\(16), the actual synaptic weight matrix **W** was set to equation \\(17).",
    "With the above synaptic weight matrixe **W** and the thres",
    "Hold vector in equation \\(8), \u201c110\u201d can be correctly retrieved using the MHN fabricated on the PCB.",
    "**Multi-associative memory**",
    "Similar to the requirement for single associative memory, when the two patterns \u201c000\u201d and \u201c101\u201d, are stored in the MHN, equations \\(18) and \\(19) should be satisfied.",
    "With _w_<sub>11</sub>= _w_<sub>22</sub>= _w_<sub>33</sub>= 0, _w_<sub>12</sub>= _w_<sub>21</sub>, _w_<sub>13</sub>= _w_<sub>31</sub>, and _w_<sub>23</sub>= _w_<sub>32</sub> and _\u03b8_<sub>1</sub>= _",
    "\u03b8_<sub>2</sub>= _\u03b8_<sub>3</sub>= _\u03b8_, equations \\(18) and \\(19) are respectively simplified as equations \\(20) and \\(21).",
    "Equations \\(20) and \\(21) can be satisfied with the following setting: _\u03b8_=6/60, _w_<sub>12</sub>=1/60, _w_<sub>13</sub>=8/60, and _w_<sub>23</sub>=4/60.",
    "Thus the synaptic weight matrix is given by equation \\(22), and the thres",
    "Hold vector is given by equation \\(23).",
    "Putting equations \\(22) and \\(23) and **X**\\(0) \\(**X**\\(0) can be varied from \u201c000\u201d to \u201c111\u201d) into equation \\(3), \u201c000\u201d and \u201c101\u201d can be stored into and retrieved from the MHN theoretically.",
    "For the synaptic weight matrix given in equation \\(22), the resistance matrix obtained from equation \\(2) can be set to the form of equation \\(24).",
    "The actual resistance matrix and the actual synaptic weight matrix of the fabricated MHN are given by equations \\(25) and \\(26), respectively:"
