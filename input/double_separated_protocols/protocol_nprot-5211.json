    "1.",
    "The name of the PDB file of the model to be evaluated. \r\n  ",

    "Note that there can be many links, so multiple files will be created.",
    "The files created are simple PDB files which can be open in any structure visualization software together with the model PDB file to visualize the topological distance.",
    "For the execution of TopoLink in multiple models, it is recommended not to write link files, using printlinks no.",

    "The next important parameter of the TopoLink in",
    "Put file is the definition of which links are to be searched and computed.",
    "There are three options: ",
    "compute observed",
    "compute all",
    "compute reactive",
    "When using compute observed, only the links that were observed experimentally \\(",
    "See below) will be computed. ",
    "If compute all is used instead, all possible crosslinks will be computed.",
    "That means that, given the definition of the linker used, TopoLink will search for consistent topological distances for every pair of residues that could, by the chemical nature of the linker and the residues involved, be attached by the linker. ",
    "Finally, compute reactive tells TopoLink to consider that only residues that were experimentally observed to react \\(by participating in observed crosslinks or dead-ends) are reactive.",
    "Then, TopoLink will search for topological distances consistent with the linker used only between these pairs of \"observed-reactive\" residues. ",
    "Additionally, the user may optionally choose to compute only the crosslinks between different chains of the PDB file, for instance to compute inter-proteins crosslinks in a complex.",
    "To do so, just ",
    "Add the ",
    "interchain",
    "option to the in",
