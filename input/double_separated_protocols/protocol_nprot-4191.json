    "**Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Culture:**",
    "The murine embryonic stem cell \\(mESC) line D3 was cultivated on mitotically inactivated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(MEFs).",
    "**Embryoid body formation:**",
    "About 75 drops of ES medium containing various numbers of ES cells were placed on the  lids  of  10 cm  petri  dishes filled with  phosphate-buffered  saline \\(PBS) and were cultivated as hanging drops for 2 days.",
    "EB aggregates were then transferred from the hanging drops into 6 cm bacteriological petri  dishes and were further cultivated for 5 days in suspension.",
    "**Generation of ESC-derived Neural Progenitor Cells \\(NPCs):**",
    "Embryoid bodies \\(EBs) generated from mESCs by the hanging ",
    "Drop method were plated in Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium containing 10% FCS on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes.",
    "After 1 day, medium was replaced with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium:Ham\u2019s F-12 \\(DMEM/F-12) supplemented with 5 \u00b5g/ml insulin, 50 \u00b5g/ml transferrin, 30 nM selenium and 5 \u00b5g/ml fibronectin.",
    "Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 7 days, generating NPCs.",
    "**Enrichment of NCSCs from NPCs with CD57 expression sorting:**",
    "Dissociated NPCs were plated on poly-D-lysine/fibronectin \\(both at 150 \u00b5g/ml) coated culture dishes and cultured in NCSC medium, consisting of 5:3 DMEM low-glucose:neurobasal medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF, 20 ng/ml IGF-1, 1% N2 supplement, 2% B27 supplement, 35 ng/ml retinoic acid, 50 \u00b5M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 15% chicken embryonic extract.",
    "The cells were cultured for 7 days in a hypoxia chamber adjusted to 3% oxygen.",
    "FACS sorting of low-enriched NCSC-like population for expression of CD57 generated higher-enriched NCSC-like cells.",
    "CD57 antibody \\(clone NK1, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for FACS sorting.",
    "**Higher Enrichment of SAP-like Cells by Sorting for Expression of GD2:**",
    "Low-enriched NCSC-like population were FACS-sorted for GD2 expression to ",
    "Generate highly-enriched SAP-like cells.",
    "GD2 antibody \\(Clone 14.G2a, BD Biosciences) was used to ",
    "Stain the cells for 30 min, followed by FACS sorting."
