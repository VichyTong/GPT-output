    "In the event of a confirmed or suspicious death by COVID-19, the MIA/US team is reported and the body referred to an admission room at our mortuary.",

    "Prepare the body for the procedure, by covering it with and additional and more resistant plastic bag, by sliding it through a stretcher with pulleys.",
    "After this procedure, the body is conducted by the MIA/US technicians to the examination room.</p><p><br></p><p>Access to the autopsy room is limited to two people, the US examiner and the supporting technician, who will be wearing PPE (surgical clothing protected by two aprons, rubber boot, sleeve, 3 layers of gloves, rubber cap, N95 mask under surgical mask and eye protection) following standard protocols.<sup>3,15</sup>",

    "Sampling protocol</strong></p><p>We used a portable SonoSite M-Turbo R (Fujifilm, Bothell, WA, USA) ultrasound equipment with C60x (5-2 MHz Convex) multi-frequency broadband transducers and DICOM<sup>R</sup> standard images.",
    "This transducer was employed since the lower frequency of ultrasound waves permits a deeper visualization of all organs, including pulmonary parenchyma.",
    "For superficial structure such as salivary glands and testis, we used the HFL38X (13-6 MHz Linear), since the higher frequency produces higher image resolution.",
    "Tissue puncture and collection was made using Tru-Cut<sup>R</sup> semi-automatic coaxial needles of 14G, 20 cm long.",
    "Examples of images obtained in COVID-19 are presented in Figures 1 and 2.</p><p>",

    "We start with a left incision immediately adjacent to the external bone, to access the heart and left lung.",
    "After completing the tissue sampling at this site, the incision is closed and a new one is done at the right paraexternal area to sample the right lung.",
    "Again the incision is closed and subsequent incisions are done at the right subcostal space (liver and right kidney) and left subcostal space (spleen and left kidney).",
    "Image guided samples are taken from salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and minor salivary glands).",

    "In addition, plastic vials containing the sampled material have their external surfaces sterilized with 70% isopropyl&nbsp;alcohol solution&nbsp;to avoid contamination of the staff involved in tissue processing.</p><p>",
