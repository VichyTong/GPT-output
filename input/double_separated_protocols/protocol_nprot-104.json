    "**Subject recruitment**",
    "1| Subjects should have a normal sleep-wake cycle, including a regular sleep-wake schedule within the last 4 weeks.",
    "**CRITICAL STEP** Do not use electrical stimulation in humans with anamnestic indications of seizure disorders, who possess metallic foreign bodies \\(pacemaker, metallic implantations), have a skull fracture, who show any signs of neurological diseases, or severe systemic diseases with effects on the central nervous system or cardiovascular regulation, or on pregnant women.

    "3| Degrease, disinfect the sites for the stimulating electrodes \\(F3, F4, right and left mastoids).",
