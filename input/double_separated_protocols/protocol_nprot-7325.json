    "Obtain 3.7cm/y recession in the present time.\r\n  ",
    "2.Set up the numerical integration of the reciprocal of the Velocity of Recession and spatially intagrate it from a given lunar orbit to the present lunar orbit of 3.884^8m.",
    "3.",
    "Through several iterations make the integrand converge to the past geologic epoch time magnitude.",
    "This gives the desired lunar orbit which existed in the past geologic epoch.\r\n  ",
    "4. Substitute this desired lunar orbi in LOD expression in hours.\r\n  ",
    "5.We have obtained the LOD in the given past geologic epoch.t"
