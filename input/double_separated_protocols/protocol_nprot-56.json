    "Preparation of worms**",
    "For worm strains with a brood size similar to wild-type worms, approximately 10 L1 worms are added to each well of a 96-well plate.  ",
    "For worm strains with a reduced brood size, more worms should be used per well such that the total brood per well is similar to that of wild-type worms &#x2013; this allows easy comparison between wells and the robust identification of genetic interactions.  ",

    "Wash worms off plates in M9 buffer and ",
    "Isolate L1s by centrifugation through a 10 &#xB5;m mesh for 10 seconds at 1,000 rpm.  ",
    "Alternatively, L1s can be prepared by bleaching gravid adults on the previous day and hatching worms overnight in M9 buffer.  ",
    "L1 worms should be re-suspended at a concentration of approximately 10 L1 worms per 10 &#xB5;l of M9 buffer.",

    "Compare the RNAi phenotypes observed in a mutant strain with that seen in wild-type \\(N2) worms.  ",
    "This can be achieved by alternating rows of wild-type and mutant worms in a 96-well plate, each row fed with the same bacterial clones \\(",

    "Add an equal volume of each bacterial feeding clone to each well \\(20 &#xB5;l of each strain, grown overnight and induced independently).  ",

    "To avoid evaporation of liquid from wells, 96-well plates should be stacked in plastic containers within the incubator.  ",

    "To identify genetic interactions, an RNAi phenotype observed in a mutant worm strain is directly compared to both the RNAi phenotype observed in wild-type worms and to the phenotype of the mutant strain fed on a control bacterial strain.  ",
