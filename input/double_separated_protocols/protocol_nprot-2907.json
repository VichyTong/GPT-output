    "Pressure incubator was designed from a 5-L pressure cooker \\(Domestic kitchen pressure cooker, Hawkins Cookers Ltd., Mumbai, India).",
    "The pressure regulator \\(vent weight) from the lid was removed and one end of a 1-m pressure tube \\(or laboratory high vacuum tube) was inserted through the vent pipe of the pressure cooker; the other end of the tube was connected to a three-way connector.",
    "One of the outlays of the connector is connected to a pressure gauge through a rubber tube and further connected to a laboratory argon cylinder.",
    "Third outlay of the connector was used for release of excess pressure and also release of pressure after each ELISA step.",
