    "This helps reducing stress levels during experiment day.</p><p>",
    "In line with the aim of stress reduction on experiment day, we recommend two training sessions (one per day) the week before (in the same conditions of the study) of at least two hours with the jacket.",
    "This also allows the experimenter to identify rats who may cause potential problems during recording and to ",
    "Take precautions for experiment day (<strong>Fig.",

    "We recommend using the same jacket per animal per study (several days to several weeks) as long as the size is adapted.",
