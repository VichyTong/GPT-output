    "<p><strong>Institutional Policies</strong></p><p>Some aspects of EEG research may be more appropriately determined and implemented by a researcher\u2019s institution (including subunits of the institution, such as a department or building).",
    "In such cases, the institutional policies will typically ",
    "Take precedence over laboratory policy.",
    "We anticipate that many institutions will adopt the following policies:</p><p><u>Symptom screening</u></p><p>",
    "Researchers and subjects who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., from this <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CDC</a> list) or who have had recent contact with someone with COVID-19 may not be allowed to enter the building and/or laboratory.",
    "If rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing is available, participants and researchers may be required to be tested before entering the building.",
    "Rationale: Allowing individuals with evidence of COVID-19 infection into the building or laboratory may ",
    "Increase the risks substantially.</p><p><u>Daily temperature screening</u></p><p>",
    "Researcher personnel may be asked to ",
    "Take their temperature once or twice per day.",
    "Rationale:",
    "This may help prevent infected persons from entering the laboratory.</p><p><u>Risk factor screening</u></p><p>Researchers and subjects who are over age 65 and/or have health conditions associated with serious complications of COVID-19 (e.g., as described by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.021\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Zheng et al., 2020</u></a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa415\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Lighter et al., 2020</u></a>) may be precluded from participating in in-person data collection.",
    "Rationale:",
    "It is impossible to guarantee that the risk of infection from an EEG experiment will be zero, so it may be desirable to exclude individuals who are more likely to experience serious complications of an infection, especially in research with no direct benefits to the subjects or no near-term bene",
    "Fit to health and well-being.</p><p><u>Face masks while in public spaces</u></p><p>Both subjects and experimenters may be required to wear masks while in any public areas of the building (including hallways and bathrooms).",

    "Read of airborne virus particles.</p><p><u>Personnel density</u></p><p>",
    "The number of people (including both researchers and subjects) within a laboratory area may be limited.",

    "Maintain a log of who enters a building or laboratory, the time of entry and departure, and contact information (email and phone number).",
    "Rationale:",
    "This will facilitate contact tracing.</p><p><u>Notification of infections</u></p><p>Subjects may be asked to contact the lab if they develop a COVID-19 infection after the session (e.g., within 14 days), and the lab may be required to contact all subjects and research staff who were in the lab within a short time (e.g., 48 hours) of an infected person.",
