    "**Transfection Protocol**:",
    "There are two transfection protocols for transfecting endothelial cells, one protocol uses the Targefect-HUVEC \\(Targefect F-2) reagent along with the VIrofect enhancer and is used for transfecting cells in presence of serum.   ",
    "These protocls are applicable ",
    "The second protocol uses the Targefect -HUVEC \\(Targefect F-2) reagent along with the Peptide enahncer and requires that cell be transfected in the absence fo serum.  ",
    "Both protocols  work well and there is lab to lab variation as to which one is preferred so we really suggest tryign both procols.",
    "For transfecting  HUVECs, BAECs and microvascular endothelial cells using the Vriofect enhancer, we have noticed that endothelial cells should be grown in media containing at least 10% serum.  ",
    "**General considerations:**:  ",
