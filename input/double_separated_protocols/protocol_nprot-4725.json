    "**2|** Transcardially ",
    "Perfuse the animal with 20 ml of ice-cold HBSS supplemented with heparin \\(10 units/ml) in 1 min.",
    "The clearing of the liver indicates a good systemic perfusion.",
    "**3|** Transcardially ",
    "Perfuse the animal with 40 ml of ice-cold 4% \\(wt/vol) PFA/PBS\\(\u2013) in 2 min. Care should be taken not to introduce air bubbles while transferring from HBSS to this fixative.",
    "The hardening of the liver indicates a good systemic fixation. ",
    "**CAUTION** ",
    "Freshly prepared 4% \\(wt/vol) PFA/PBS\\(\u2013) should be used for efficient fixation.",
    "Check its pH prior to use.",
    "It should be neutral or slightly alkaline \\(pH 7.6\u20137.8). ",
    "**CAUTION**",
    "The perfusion ",
    "Flow rate should be not less than 20 ml/min for a rapid and uniform fixation.",
    "Slow perfusion may result in tissue autolysis due to post-mortem effects. ",
    "**4|** Dissect out the brain and post",
    "Fix it with 25\u201330 ml of 4% \\(wt/vol) PFA/PBS\\(\u2013) \\(pH 7.6\u20137.8) for 8\u201372 hrs at 4 \u00baC with mild shaking. ",
    "**5|** Store the sample in PBS\\(\u2013) at 4 \u00baC until use but for not more than 1 week.",
    "**CRITICAL STEP**",
    "The apparent fluorescence of the brain sample is reduced during postfixation, but can be recovered substantially after several hour incubation in PBS\\(\u2013).",
    "At this stage, it is recommended that fluorescent pictures of the brain are taken using a fluorescence stereomicroscope for records.",
    "These images may be compared with those after deSca_l_ing for assessment of fluorescence preservation during treatments with Sca_l_eS0, Sca_l_eS1, Sca_l_eS2, and Sca_l_eS3. ",
    "ii) Clearing",

    "The transparent sample can be stored in Sca_l_eS4D25 at 4 \u00baC for >1 year.",
    "iii) Immobilization",
    "The Sca_l_eS4D25-treated tissue floats in the mounting solution, such as Sca_l_eS4D25 and Sca_l_eS4D2.5, and needs to be immobilized in a container for high-resolution fluorescence observation.",
    "Here the sample is supposed to be immobilized onto a culture dish for epi-fluorescence observation using CLSM, which is common laboratory equipment.",
    "Also, the immobilization is designed for an upright microscope with dipping objectives that have long working distances \\(**Figure 1e**), and therefore requires a tall plastic dish.",
    "The following 2 methods assume an experiment, where the hemisphere or a 1\u20133-mm-thick slice of the YFP-H mouse brain is imaged deep for a high-resolution 3D reconstruction of YFP-expressing neurons.",
    "In many cases, furthermore, the experiment aims at wide imaging to ",
