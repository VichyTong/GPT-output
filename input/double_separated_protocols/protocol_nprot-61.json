    "**1. Overview**",
    "In each experimental session, 18 participants first received some preliminary verbal instructions as a group, where we informed them about the general experimental procedures.",
    "Moreover, the basic structure of the game was explained to the group, but the experimenter did not mention the different treatment conditions.",
    "Thus, subjects at this stage did not yet know that they would face players from different clan.",
    "This has the advantage that all participants received the same view of the game.",
    "We ensured that the participants did not communicate about the game before they participated in the experiment.",
    "Each participant received a show-up fee of K3 and drew a number at the beginning of the game.",
    "One at a time, in the order of the numbers drawn, the subjects then came into a ",
    "Separate room to participate in the experiment.",
    "The game was then explained again to them individually in much detail after they entered the experiment room; this time the instruction ",
    "Include the information about their own role in the game and the group affiliation of the other two players.",
    "Since many of the participants had little or no education, the experimenter \\(H. Bernhard, who speaks Neo-Melanesian \\[Pidgin]) explained the experiment with coins and cups, representing the three players A, B, and C, before asking test questions.",
    "Participants who failed to understand the instructions were dismissed from the experiment but could ",
    "Keep their show-up fee.",
    "The subjects who answered the test questions correctly were then asked to make their decision.",
    "Subjects in the role of player A decided how much of their endowment of K10 they want to ",
    "Transfer to player B. Subjects in the role of player C decided whether to spend K0, K1 or K2 on the punishment of player A. Each K spent on punishment reduced A&#x2019;s earnings by K3. ",
    "We elicited player C&#x2019;s punishment decision with the strategy method.",
    "This means that player C indicated how much he is willing to spend on punishment for each of player A&#x2019;s feasible transfers.",
    "Player C made this decision before he knew the dictator&#x2019;s actual ",
    "Transfer level.",
    "The strategy method has the great advantage that we also ",
    "Collect information about punishment at ",
    "Transfer levels that player A did not actually choose, which considerably increases the statistical power of our results.",
    "Since we collected 11 punishment decisions from each player C &#x2013; one punishment decision for each feasible ",
    "Transfer level &#x2013; we always controlled for repeated measurement in the statistical analysis of punishment decisions.",
    "The strategy method has been widely and successfully applied in experimental games.",
    "In principle, it is possible that this method generates different results than the specific response method where individuals only respond to the specific actions the other players take.",
    "However, many studies indicate that the two methods ",
    "Generate qualitatively similar behaviours \\[1-4].",
    "The strategy method might somewhat ",
    "Reduce the strength of punishment relative to the specific response method \\[2, 4] but several investigations also indicate that it has no effect \\[1, 3].",
    "However, as we implemented the strategy method in all treatment conditions, the behavioral impact of this method, if there is any, would be kept constant across treatments.",
    "Immediately after they had made their decisions, we elicited every player A&#x2019;s and every player C&#x2019;s expectation about punishment for transfers of K0, K5 and K10 \\(e.g.",
    "for K0: _",
    "If Person A gives K0 to Person B and keeps K10 for himself, do you think most people in the ",
    "Position of Person C would pay money in order to punish Person A?_",
    "When the subject answered with &#x201C;yes&#x201D; we asked: _How much?_).",
    "The games were first conducted with the Ngenikas, then with the Wolimbkas.",
    "The Wolimbka participants were paid after everyone in the session had made their decision.",
    "After having played with the Wolimbkas, we returned to the Ngenikas and paid them their money according to the Wolimbkas' decisions.",
    "Thus the time lag between the game play and the payment was about ten days for the Ngenikas.",
    "They entered the classroom one by one for payment.",
    "We briefly explained which decisions had been made and paid the players their money \\(handed over in envelopes).",
    "Moreover, each Ngenika received K2 as a thank you for coming a second time. ",

    "**2. Game Instructions**",
