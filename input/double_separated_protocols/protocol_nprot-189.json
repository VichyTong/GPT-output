    "**Protocols and procedures for surgery and imaging:**",
    "The following protocols for &#x201C;open-skull&#x201D; and &#x201C;thinned-skull&#x201D; surgery are similar to those described previously \\(1-6).",
    "**Thinned-skull preparation:**",
    "1.",
    "Anesthetize transgenic mice by intraperitoneal injection \\(0.2 ml/20 g body weight) of 20 mg/ml Ketamine and 3 mg/ml Xylazine in 0.9% NaCl.\r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "Thoroughly shave the hair over most of the scalp with a conventional razor blade.      ",
    "Perform a midline scalp incision using microsurgical tools.",
    "Incision should extend     approximately from the neck region to the frontal area.  ",
    "The brain area to be imaged can be localized based on stereotactic coordinates \\(7).\r\n  ",
    "3. Re",
    "Move soft tissue attached to the skull over the area to be imaged with fine forceps.",
    "High-speed micro-drill is used to thin a circular area of skull \\(typically ~1 mm in diameter) over the region of interest under a dissection microscope.",
    "Drilling should be done intermittently and the drill bit can be immersed periodically in cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid \\(ACSF) solution to minimize ",
    "Heat induced tissue injury.",
    "\r\n  ",
    "4.",
    "The mouse skull consists of two thin layers of compact bone, sandwiching a thick layer of spongy tissue.",
    "This spongy bone contains tiny cavities arranged in concentric circles and multiple canaliculi that ",
    "Carry blood vessels.",
    "After removing the external compact bone, the middle layer of spongy bone is carefully thinned to about 75% of its original thickness.",
    "Some bleeding from the blood vessels running through the canaliculi may occur during the thinning process.  ",
    "This bleeding will usually stop spontaneously.  \r\n  5.",
    "After removing the majority of the spongy bone, concentric cavities within the bone can usually be seen under the dissecting microscope, indicating the drill is ",
    "Close to the internal compact bone layer.  ",
    "At this stage, skull thickness should be more than 50 &#xB5;m and the edge of the thinned region is thicker. \r\n  ",
    "6.",
    "The mouse skull is then immobilized by gluing it to a metal ",
    "Plate made by gluing 3 razor blades together.",
    "Place a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue around the edges of the internal opening of the blade and press the blade against the skull leaving the area to be imaged uncovered and surrounded by the internal blade opening.",
    "Pay special attention to avoid contamination with glue of the thin skull area.\r\n  ",
    "7. Wait 10&#x2013;15 minutes until the metal ",
    "Plate is firmly glued to the skull and ",
    "Place the mouse face down with the blades supported by the acrylic blocks.",
    "Tighten up the screws to completely immobilize the blades.",
    "Wash the area to be imaged extensively with ACSF to ",
    "Re",
    "Move remnants of non-polymerized glue.  ",
    "We have observed that the microscope objectives retain trace amounts of glue remnants if the preparation is not washed thoroughly.  ",
    "We recommend keeping the objectives immersed in water after imaging and cleaning them periodically with 100% ethanol.\r\n  ",
    "8.",
    "After the immobilization of the mouse skull, a microsurgical blade \\(Surgistar, Cat# 38-6961) is used to continue thinning a smaller area \\( <sub>200 &#xB5;m in diameter) to </sub>20 &#xB5;m in thickness.",
    "The bone is shaved by using the blade at <sub>45 degree angle, taking great precaution not to push the skull downwards against the brain surface or to break through the bone, as minor brain trauma or bleeding may potentially cause inflammation and disruption of neuronal structures.",
    "The thinning continues until a very thin \\( </sub>20 &#xB5;m) and smooth preparation \\( ~200 &#xB5;m in diameter) is achieved.  ",
    "The optimal degree of skull thinning is ultimately determined by looking at the preparation with a conventional fluorescence microscope.",
    "Dendrites and spines in the area of interest should be clearly visualized at this stage.\r\n  ",
    "**Open-skull preparation:**",
    "1.",
    "Anesthetize transgenic mice and shave the hair over most of the scalp according to steps 1&#x2013;2 as described in thinned-skull preparation.\r\n  ",
    "2. Administer dexamethasone \\(0.02 ml at 4 mg/ml) by intramuscular injection and ",
    "Re",
    "Move soft tissue attached to the skull over the area to be imaged with fine forceps. \r\n  ",
    "3. Use a high-speed micro-drill \\(1/4 bit, Fine Science Tools) to thin a circumference of a 5 x 5 mm region of the skull over the region of interest under a dissection microscope.",
    "Drilling should be done intermittently and the drill bit can be immersed periodically in cold ACSF solution to minimize ",
    "Heat induced tissue injury.",
    "\r\n  ",
    "4. Take great caution to lift up the island of bone within the drilled circle with a pair of sharp forceps.",
    "Immediately after removing 5 x 5 mm region of the skull, bleeding above dura may occur in 2&#x2013;3 locations as such tiny bleeding is presumably from small blood vessels attached to the removed skull.  ",
    "But such bleeding should stop spontaneously within 10&#x2013;20 seconds.",
    "Rinse the cortex with room temperature ACSF once or twice if necessary.",
    "At this step, make sure there is absolutely no bleeding under the dura.   \r\n  ",
    "5. Cover the clear dura with a thin layer of low-melting-point agarose \\(Sigma) \\(1.2% in ACSF).",
    "Make sure that 1.2% freshly-made agarose is ",
    "Cool than 37 &#xB0;C before applying it to the cortex. \r\n  ",
    "6.",
    "A custom-made circular coverslip \\(5&#x2013;7 mm diameter, No. 1 thickness) is gently lowered to ",
    "Cover the open-skull region.",
    "Take great caution not to push the cortex underneath and ",
    "Re",
    "Move any excess agarose with sterile cotton applicators. \r\n  ",
    "7. Seal the edge of the optical window to the skull with a thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue and then with dental acrylic.  ",
    "The dental acrylic will also ",
    "Cover all the exposed areas of skull.  ",
    "A small custom-made steel bar will be embedded into the acrylic to stabilize the animal during subsequent imaging.\r\n  ",
    "8.",
    "Allow the mice to re",
    "Cover 7&#x2013;14 days before chronic imaging starts. \r\n  ",
    "**Mapping the imaging area for future relocation:**",
    "In order to identify the same imaged area at a later time point, a high quality picture of the meningeal blood vessels is first obtained as landmark for relocation.   ",
    "This can be done with a CCD camera attached to a stereo dissecting microscope.  ",
    "Subsequently, the mouse is placed under an epi-fluorescence microscope and a specific area is selected for two-photon imaging.",
    "The selected area is then carefully identified in the CCD camera map by observing on the epi-fluorescence microscope the pattern of brain vasculature adjacent to it and then marking it on the map.  ",
    "    ",
    "**Two-photon imaging of neuronal structures.",
    "**",
    "1.",
    "Tune the TPM to the appropriate wavelength \\(e.g.",
    "920 nm for YFP).",
    "Imaging is done by using a 60x water-immersion objective \\(Olympus, N.A. 0.9).",
    "ACSF should be used at all times during imaging for objective immersion.\r\n  ",
    "2. Obtain a stack of fluorescently labeled neuronal processes at a digital zoom of 1x.",
    "These low magnification images are useful as a more precise map for relocation of the same area at a later time point in conjunction with the CCD camera picture of meningeal blood vessels.\r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "Without changing the ",
    "Position of the stage, ",
    "Take a zoomed image of the same area \\(e.g.",
    "3x zoom).",
    "The stack depth is typically 100 &#xB5;m below the pial surface.  ",
    "Additional zoomed images can be taken around the central image by electronically moving the imaging ",
    "Position 360&#xBA; around the initial imaged area.",
    "We typically use laser intensities in the range of 10 to 20 milliwatts \\(measured at the sample) to minimize phototoxicity \\(8).",
    "So far, our studies have limited to spines within the first 100 &#x3BC;m from the pial surface.  ",
    "It is worth to point out that we found that the open-skull window is somewhat better for imaging structures &gt; 200 &#x3BC;m deeper under the pial surface than the thinned-skull window.",
    "Presumably this is because the coverglass and thinned-skull ",
    "Induce different degrees of spherical aberration and spherical aberration has a larger effect on imaging of deeper tissues.  \r\n  ",
    "4.",
    "Following imaging, the head immobilization device is gently detached from the skull with thinned-skull preparations.  ",
    "The scalp is sutured with 6-0 silk \\(LOOK, Reading, PA) and the mouse is kept in a ",
    "Separate cage until fully awake then ",
    "Put back in the original cage until the next viewing.  ",
    "For open skull preparations, simply dismount the steel bar from a fixing post. \r\n  5.",
    "Image stacks can be viewed and analyzed with ImageJ software obtained from the NIH."
