    "Note: For optimal results, stabilize harvested tissues immediately in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent is recommended.",
    "Tissues can be stored in the reagent for up to 1 day at 37&#x00B0;C, 7 days at 15-25&#x00B0;C, or 4 weeks at 2-8&#x00B0;C, or archived at -20&#x00B0;C or -80&#x00B0;C.",

    "Immediately disrupt and ",
    "Homogenize the tissue using a conventional rotor-stator homogenizer \\(Polytron) until it is uniformly homogeneous \\(at least 20s).",
