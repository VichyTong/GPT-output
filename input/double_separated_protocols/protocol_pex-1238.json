    "Run approximately 2 focus groups, one for people who are colour blind (n~10), one for people at risk of developing colour blindness with age (n~20) in which the charts will be reviewed.",
    "This will enable us to ",
    "Determine if colour blind patients who do not have a regular carer/person able to help them with the colour chart can use a colour chart safely.",
    "At focus groups we will show the chart to participants and ask them to discuss how it appears to them, and whether they can tell the difference between shades shown.",
    "We will use a topic guide to ",
    "Ensure that questions are structured, and responses during the group will be recorded for subsequent analysis using the framework method(3).</p><p><br></p><p>Each participant will also be asked to provide basic demographic information, such as age and medical history, and will have their colour vision tested using a computer graphics based system which has been appropriately validated in clinical conditions known to impair colour vision(1) and against older methods of diagnosing colour vision defects such as the Fransworth Munsall 100 Hue chart(4).",
    "In brief the technique involves looking at a computer screen and counting dots seen of various colours and intensities, after which a report is generated detailing vision along the protan and tritan axes.",
    "Importantly the system is sensitive enough to diagnose all major types of colour defect, is simple to use, and the equipment is available free of charge locally, having been funded by a previous grant.",
    "This will enable us to assess: (i) whether perceptions of the utility of the chart vary with colour blindness type (ii) whether the degree of undiagnosed colour blindness in at risk groups is likely to be significant enough to impair use in daily practice.</p><p><br></p><p>Participants will be recruited via Colour Blind Awareness and advertisements to patient groups locally, such as the Clinical Research Ambassadors Group (CRAG) at University Hospitals Birmingham, as well as to the public at the University.",
    "We anticipate that the majority of our known colour blind subjects will be recruited from the University student population and/or Colour Blind Awareness, whilst the \u2018at risk\u2019 subjects will be via patient groups.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Protocol",
