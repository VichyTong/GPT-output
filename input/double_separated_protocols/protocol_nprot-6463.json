    "Store overnight \\(8-12 h) at 4\u00b0C.",
    "Cyclophilin A-stained samples are typically assessed within 2-5 days but might be stored longer \\(2-3 weeks).",
    "The aqueous mounting medium is non-hardening, i.e. it remains liquid on the slide and does not solidify.",
    "Mounted slides are usually stored without sealing.",
    "However, for long-term storage, coverslips can be sealed with nail polish or an appropriate sealant.",
    "40 Subject slides to microscopic evaluation.",
    "CRITICAL STEP For optimum results, ",
    "Run a pilot experiment with a limited number of samples to establish an appropriate imaging protocol which can be used throughout experimentation.",
    "This protocol typically includes parameters such as excitation intensity, detector gain and exposure time, and many more.",
    "If available, a transmitted light imaging mode \\(e.g. phase contrast) should be incorporated into these settings.",
    "The phase contrast and confocal epifluorescence images can be acquired simultaneously, and when merged, ",
    "Give valuable information about the precise location of the labeled cells within the tissue.",
    "This feature is especially helpful for studies of the teratoma/tumor microenvironment since it allows to track host cell infiltration, and at the same time to ",
    "Evaluate its impact on tissue properties and condition.",
    "Always use the same imaging and post-acquisition protocols to analyse your samples of interest and the respective positive and/or negative controls."
