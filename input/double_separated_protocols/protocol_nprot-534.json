    "Later, once the oligonucleotides have been synthesized, they could be mixed, hybridized and the complete gene could be synthesized via PCR reaction \\(Casimiro et al, 1997; Kodumal et al, 2004; Tsuchiya et al, 2006).",
    "Following the synthesis of the gene, it can be inserted into the respective vectors by following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocols for that particular vector \\(Kodumal et al, 2004)."
