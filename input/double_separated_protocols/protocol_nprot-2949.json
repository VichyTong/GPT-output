    "1. Preparation of PP\u00b5TP\r\n  PP\u00b5TP was made from locally purchased white polypropylene sheet.",
    "The sheet was ",
    "Cut into a strip having dimension of 9 cm in length and 3 cm in width.",
    "On the strip, array of test zones \\(small cavities) were made by mildly hammering or pressing with a blunt end metal rod.",
    "Each cavity was separated by 0.5 cm.",
    "Cavity of the PP\u00b5TP had an average diameter of 3.5 mm and a depth of around 1 mm.",
    "All the dimensions were measured by an electronic caliper. ",
    "2.",
    "Activation of PP\u00b5TP \r\n  ",
    "The wells of a PP\u00b5TP were activated by pouring FNAB \\(0.0625 mg/2.5\u00b5l of methanol/cavity)  solution to each well followed by slow evaporation of the solvent.",
    "The ",
    "Dry coated ",
    "Plate was activated by UV light for 20  min at a wavelength of 365 nm as described \\(1).    ",
    "CRITICAL   Fast evaporation may ",
    "Re",
    "Move  FNAB from the bottom of the cavity to the top.",
    "In such case activation may not occur at the bottom.",
    "3. Detection of analyte\r\n  Analyte \\( human IgG, human IgE) was detected by immobilizing a ",
    "Capture molecule \\(anti-human IgG, anti-human IgE,) onto the activated and untreated cavities of PP\u00b5TP, blocking, binding  of analyte  and binding  of secondary antibody-conjugate by ultrasound waves in a sonicator bath operating at a frequency of 40 KHz and  an out",
    "Put power of 120 W. The plates were washed after each step.",
    "Color development was carried out by adding 8\u00b5l of substrate- dye buffer and then stopped by adding 2\u00b5l of 5% sulphuric acid. ",
    "4. Image- based quantification\r\n  The PP\u00b5TP was then scanned on a desktop scanner \\(HP photo smart C6388) by placing the ",
    "Plate upside down to get the image.",
    "From Adobe Photoshop the mean value of each R, G and B of the scanned image was obtained which was then converted to HSB \\(Hue, Saturation, and Brightness) using freely available \u2018Macbeth color calculator\u2019 software.",
    "Image was then quantified as color saturation percentage."
