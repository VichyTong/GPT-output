    "SOAPdenovo employs the de Bruijn graph algorithm in order both to simplify the task of assembly and to ",
    "Reduce computational complexity.",
    "Low quality reads were filtered and potential sequencing errors were removed by k-mer frequency-based error correction.",
    "We filtered the following type of reads:",
    "1.",
    "Reads having an \u2018N\u2019 over 10% of its length. \r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "Reads from short insert-size libraries having more than 65% of bases with quality \u22647, and reads from large insert-size libraries that contained more than 80% of bases with a quality \u2264 7.\r\n  3.",
    "Reads with more than 10 bp from the adapter ",
    "Sequence \\(allowing \u22642 bp mismatches).\r\n  ",
    "4. Small insert size paired-end reads that overlapped \u226510 bp between two ends. \r\n  ",

    "6.",
    "Reads having a k-mer frequency <4 \\(to minimize the influence of sequencing errors).\r\n  ",
    "SOAPdenovo first constructs the _de Bruijn_ graph by splitting the reads from short insert size libraries \\(200-500bp) into 31-mers and then merging the 31-mers \\( 30bp overlaps with 1 bp overhangs); contigs were then collected which exhibited unambiguous connections in _de Bruijn_ graphs.",
    "Reads from mate-paired libraries \\(insert size >2k) were aligned onto the contigs for scaffold building using the paired-end information.",
    "This paired-end information was subsequently used to link contigs into scaffolds, step by step, from short insert sizes to long insert sizes.",
    "**2.  RNA-seq sequencing**",
    "1| Homogenise frozen tissues in Trizol reagent in a bead mill with 5mm stainless steel beads. ",

    "Briefly: Use oligo\\(dT) magnetic beads to ",
    "Purify the poly-A containing mRNA molecules.",
    "Further fragment the mRNA into short lengths by controlled temperature, and then randomly primed during first strand synthesis by reverse transcription.",
    "Follow this with second-strand synthesis with DNA polymerase I to create double-stranded cDNA fragments.",
    "Subject double stranded cDNA  to end repair by Klenow and T4 DNA polymerases and A-tailed by Klenow lacking exonuclease activity. ",

    "Gene prediction**",
    "use BLAT to map genes of IR \\(MMUL_0_1) and human \\(Ensembl release-56) onto two macaca genome, Orthologous regions were then determined by best-BLAT hit and synteny-based analysis, followed by the application of \"Exonerate\":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/ and \"GENEWISE\":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/Wise2/index.html to refine gene model at each locus.",

    "When aligning two closely related genome sequences, the frequencies of lengths of successive alignment blocks \\(which were ",
    "Split by gaps during the alignment), termed Inter-gap Segments \\(IGS), may be expected to follow a geometric frequency distribution under a standard neutral model.",

    "By quantifying this excess, several parameters viz.",
    "the proportion \\(\u025b), average density \\(D), and number \\(Ng) of the clustered erroneous gaps in the genome alignments can be estimated."
