    "In our screens of mutants, alterations at seven phenotypes covering fungal development and physiology were monitored in a step-by-step manner \\(Fig.",
    "1).",
    "Phenotypes of primary interest are growth rate, pigmentation, conidiation, conidial morphology, conidial germination, appressorium formation, and pathogenicity.",
    "In each stage, phenotypes of interest were described according to the assigned numerical scale \\(Table 1).",
    "1) Measure growth of the mutants after 3 days incubation on V8 agar.",
    "Score growth by comparing relative growth rate with that of wild-type \\(Fig.",
    "1a).",
    "2) After 6 days incubation, score mycelial color visually \\(Fig.",
    "1b).",
    "3) Harvest conidia from 6-day old cultures of mutants by adding 1ml of Tween 20 solution \\(250ppm) into each well and rubbing with cotton swab.",

    "Place in a moistened plastic box to prevent the drops from drying.  ",

    "4)  Observe conidiation, conidial morphology, conidial germination and appressorium formation under a microscope with x100 magnification \\(Fig.",
    "1c, d, e, and f).",
    "Conidiation can be scored by comparing relative number of conidia from mutants with that of wild-type.",
    "Conidial germination rate can be measured as the percentage of germinated conidia.",
    "Ability to form appressorium can be measured as the percentage of appressorium-forming conidia among the germinated conidia.",
    "5) After dropping conidial suspension onto the green mirror, use the rest of the conidial suspension for a pathogenicity test \\(Fig.",
    "1g).",
