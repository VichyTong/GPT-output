    "1. Prepare an organotypic adult retinal explant culture and ",
    "Maintain this culture.  ",
    "TIMING: 45-60 minutes per rat \\(i.e.",
    "pair of eyes) for tissue dissection; 20-30 minutes for bi-daily medium exchanges\r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "Co-culture retinal explants with dissociated cell types \\(e.g. stem cells).  ",
    "TIMING: cell transplantation 15-30 minutes \\(",
    "Add approximately 10 minutes more for each additional plate).\r\n  ",
    "3. Perform the pharmacological screen of neuroprotective drugs using retinal explants.  ",
    "TIMING: treating explants approximately 10 minutes per plate\r\n  ",
    "4.",
    "Preserve the retinal explants for histological analysis.  ",
    "TIMING: approximately 24 hour\r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "Perform cryostat sectioning of the retinal explants and label the sections by fluorescent immunohistochemistry.  ",
    "TIMING: cryoprotection and embedding ~24 hours; cryostat each explant ",
    "Block approximately 40-60 minutes; immunohistochemistry requires 2 days.\r\n  ",
    "6. Perform fluorescent immunohistochemical labelling of the whole-mount explants.  ",
    "TIMING: approximately 3 days"
