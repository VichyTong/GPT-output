    "<p>Eligibility patients:</p><p>Eligible patients have an advanced or metastatic solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and have exhausted standard treatment options.",
    "A tumor genetic or protein expression test (CPCT or regular diagnostics) must have revealed a potentially actionable variant, for which FDA and / or EMA approved targeted therapy is available, but not for the tumor type in question.",
    "In addition, patients are required to be \u226518 years of age, with acceptable organ function and performance status (ECOG \u22642), and to have objectively evaluable disease of which a fresh baseline tumor biopsy can safely be obtained.",
    "For every study drug, further drug-specific selection criteria are applied.</p><p>Case submission:</p><p>Upon case submission, the study team attempted to match each patient to the most appropriate study treatment (Extended Data Figure 1), according to pre-defined matching rules .",
    "If multiple variant-drug matches could be made for one patient, the drug with the highest level of evidence was selected, unless there\u2019s rationale (such as drug-intolerance) to justify selecting an agent with a lower level of evidence.",
    "Levels of evidence were adapted from Meric-Berstam et al.</p><p>Study treatment</p><p>If a matching study treatment slot is available, to which the patient consents, the patient can be enrolled provided that all drug-specific selection criteria were met.",
    "Afterwards a fresh baseline tumor biopsy for biomarker analyses is obtained and study treatment can be initiated.</p><p>Follow up:</p><p>Study treatment could continue until progressive disease (patients receiving immune system stimulating agents were permitted to continue treatment in case of pseudo-progression), unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, death, pregnancy, consent withdrawal or withdrawal from the study at the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>- Safety: all treatment-related CTCAE 4.03 grade \u22653 adverse events are documented.</p><p>- Response assessments: response is evaluated every two   months (up to every three months for patients who remained on-study for \u22656 months), and classified by local investigators according to the internationally accepted criteria for each tumor type.</p>"
