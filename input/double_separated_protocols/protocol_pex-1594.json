    "Tasks in several scenes (Scenes 10, 12, and 17) could be completed using only one hand, while tasks in other scenes (Scenes 3, 8, 18, and 19) require bilateral coordination of both hands.",
    "Upper limb movements in most scenes will involve aiming, shooting, hitting, waving arms, punching, and throwing objects.",
    "Upper limb movements in Scenes 18 and 19 will be more complex, since tasks in the two scenes simulated daily life activities, such as shopping, pouring water, and blending drinks.</p><p>Participants\u2019 activity performance and information will be recorded, including training intensity, duration, game scores, level completed, and invalid activities.",

    "In addition to regular occupational therapy, all participants received 16 sessions of extra intervention (one-hour activity, 2 to 3 times per week).",
    "Each session will be supervised by an occupational therapist.",
    "In the COT group, conventional instruments such as the peg board, climbing ladder, and stacking cones will be used for upper limb training.",
