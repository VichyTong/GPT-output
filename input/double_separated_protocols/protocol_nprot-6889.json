    "\\(C) At each ",

    "\\(E) Your obtained signatures from the PWAS-p patch can resemble Figure 3.  ",
    "In experiment 1, a clear distinction between conductuance and suceptance signatures existed.",
    "The signatures contain several distinct peaks, which either shifted towards right/ left \\(indicating increase/ decrease in frequency) or deviated upward/ downward \\(indicating an increase/ decrease in magnitude of admittance). ",
    "\\(F)",
    "If a peak shift to right than some other peak shifts left or vice versa and thus in general all such features are common when structure is subjected to the loading \\(Annamdas et al 2007). ",
    "\\(G)",
    "A careful inspection, which is termed as signature analysis \\(Annamdas et al 2014) should be carried out at representative tall peaks such as 1, 2 ,3 and 4 \\(as indicated in the Figure 3) in Figure 4 \\(a-b-c-d).  ",
    "2.2 Key features of signatures \\(for permanent PWAS patch)",

    "Obtain baseline signature before placing hanger on the beam and note that the hanger placement slightly displaces the boundary condition. ",
    "\\(B)",
    "Obtain loaded signatures, there will not be boundary disturbances during loading.  ",
    "Figure 4\\(a) shows signatures in the frequency range of 27-29 KHz, which presents some peaks that shifted upwards whereas the peak at 28.25KHz, indicated as 1, did not show any consistent shifting.",
    "Thus, taller peak need not show any trend of ",
    "Increase or decrease as ",
    "Load increased on the specimen.  ",
    "Figures 4 \\(b - c) shows peaks at 85.75 KHz and 121 KHz respectively, which presented a decreasing and an increasing trend as the ",
    "Load magnitude on the beam increased.",
    "Figure 4\\(d) shows a frequency range where both downward and upward shifting of different peaks were observed.  ",
    "Thus, the characteristic features of signatures for loaded specimen comprises of several peaks which either ",

    "Load increased.",
    "Hence a touch sensor also should retain these key features. ",

    "Load on the specimen at all ",
    "Your signatures can resemble Figure 5.",
    "Unlike PWAS-p, these can result in the larger magnitudes which can be added advantage.",
    "As it means that PWAS - t is more sensitive compared to permanently bonded PWAS-p patch due to absence of any bonding layer. ",
    "\\(B)",
    "Obtain a close-up view at various locations as it can show variations clearly, as similar to close-up view of Figures 6 \\(a-d).",
    "This type of signature analysis helps to find out the characteristic features of touch sensor. ",
    "\\(C) Do comparative study.",
    "In our case, Figure 6\\(a) shows a peak at 28.25 KHz, which is neither increasing nor decreasing as similar to Figure 4\\(a) of PWAS-p patch.",
    "Furthermore zero-loaded signature is different from loaded signatures indicating a probable ",
    "Change in boundary conditions, and this shift is more obvious compared to Figure 4\\(a). ",
    "\\(D) Touch sensor can show difference in boundary condition of specimen for  0gm and subsequent loads, more obviously than the permanent patch.",
    "Figure 6\\(b) shows some peaks in the range of 85.5 to 87 KHz, which shifted either upward or downward or without clear trend, i.e the behaviour is similar to PWAS-p \\(Figure 4b)",
    "but the direction of shifting is different. ",
    "\\(E) Observe any interesting features in frequency domain.",
    "In our case, there existed larger peaks beyond 86KHz \\(",
    "See Figure 5) and thus two frequency ranges were closely observed as shown in Figure 6\\(c-d), to ",
    "Figure 6 \\(d) shows a very sensitive range where the peaks shifted in higher magnitudes, than Figure 6\\(c), which too show the upward or downward deviations of loaded specimen. ",
    "\\(F) Observe any interesting features such as ",
    "Change in boundary conditions.",
    "In our case, two boundary conditions i.e at baseline \\(0 gm) and at loading ",
    "Process were observed.",
    "These signatures \\(Figure 6: a-d) show lots of information which is similar or better than the information provided by PWAS-p \\(Figure 4: a-d), which is so far considered to be best in SHM applications for EMA.",
    "It should be noted that the interaction between PWAS-p and host structure is by an epoxy layer \\(Madhav and Soh 2007), whereas in this PWAS-t, epoxy adhesive is absent and the interaction between patch and host structure is direct.",
    "However, there will not be any structural peaks but the magnetic force provides a unique bonding force.",
    "At least in our experiment, the sensitivity of this PWAS-t patch seems to be better.",

    "Record signatures from both patches after inducing cracks \\(at 0 cm, 3 cm, 6 cm, 9 cm, 12 cm, 15 cm, 18 cm and 21 cm) at regular intervals, away from the PWAS-t patch as shown in Figure.",
    "Experiment2 resulted in signatures which presents larger magnitude shifts unlike the loading increment case.",

    "\\(c) Readers can use sharp blade to ",
    "Induce cracks on specimen but in our experiment,  we used hacksaw blade.",
    "This created much disturbance to the structure and it got reflected as 'high magnitude changes in peaks and valleys'.  ",
    "It should be noted that the crack magnitude increased in steps from the location of PWAS-t towards PWAS-p as shown in Figure 2\\(d). ",
    "\\(D) You can ",
    "Obtain 2 sets of signatures, when cracks are induced away from PWAS-t and approaching PWAS-p. ",
    "\\(E) The signatures shift so large that the 'signature analysis' as carried-out in the previous ",
    "Load increment case cannot be appropriate because it does not provide meaningful shifting patterns of peaks. ",
    "\\(F) Apply root mean square deviation \\(RMSD) index to study the deviations, especially to ",
    "Quantify changes in signatures \\(Park et al 2006, Annamdas and Yang 2012).  ",
    "The RMSD is a comparable index of the initial signature with later stage signatures \\(k = 1, 2,3 \u2026).",

    "RMSD indices obtained from PWAS-p shows increasing trends as the crack magnitudes increased towards its direction whereas the RMSD indices obtained from PWAS-t shows decreasing trends as the cracks increased in the opposite direction.",
    "The larger magnitudes of RMSD indices of PWAS-t compared to RMSD-p is attributed to direct interaction between PWAS-t and the host structure unlike PWAS-p \\(which is via bonding layer).",
    "This also depends on magnetic force magnitude. ",
    "\\(I)",
    "The larger values also can be attributed to the movement of main and support magnets during the cracking ",
    "Process by hacksaw blade. ",
    "\\(J)",

    "Process and hence the movement of magnets will not occur. ",
