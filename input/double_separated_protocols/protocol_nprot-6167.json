    "For example, a strong, positive correlation between retention and cell-to-pore size may indicate that filtration is influenced by differences in cell size among samples, rather than cell deformability.",
    "In this case, complementary mechanotyping methods should be additional used that are independent of cell size, such as atomic force microscopy. \r\n  ",
