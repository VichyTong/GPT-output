    "Mammalian cells are grown under conventional conditions to around 90% confluence in 10-cm dishes.",
    "Cells are washed once with PBS and 0.5mL of Lysis buffer is added \\(RIPA or NP-40 buffer may be used instead, but the specific Enolase activity is lower) following which cells are scraped and placed in 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes.",
    "Cells are then broken by sonication and the lysate is cleared by centrifugation at 20,000g for 30 minutes.",

    "The reaction is started by the addition of 100uL of Buffer B \\(adding the enolase substrate, 2PG).",
    "This is best done using a multichannel pipet and the fluorescence reading is started as quickly as possible.",
    "Fluorescence readings \\(NADH excitation 360nm, emission 460nm) are recorded every 30 seconds.",
