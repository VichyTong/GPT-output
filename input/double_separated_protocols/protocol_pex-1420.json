    "The FPI is a diagnostic clinical tool aimed at quantifying the degree to which a foot can be considered to be in a pronated, supinated or neutral position.</p><p>These measures ",
    "Give an overall view of the foot posture and its deviations from alignment.</p><p>",
    "The reliability of this index is 0.98 and hence it is a reliable test to perform.</p><p><br></p><p>The FPI includes 6 criteria:</p><p>Talar head palpation.</p><p>Supra and infra lateral malleolar curvature.</p><p>Calcaneal frontal plane position.</p><p>Prominence in the region of talonavicular joint.</p><p>Congruence of the medial longitudinal arch.</p><p>Abduction/adduction of the fore foot on the rear foot.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of the component is graded from zero to neutral with a minimum score of -2 for clear signs of supination, and +2 for positive signs of pronation.&nbsp;</p><p>The patient should stand in their relaxed stance ",
    "Position with double limb support.",

    "MALLEOLAR CURVATURE-",
    "In the neutral foot it has been suggested that the curves should be approximately equal.",
    "In the pronated foot the curve below the malleolus will be more acute than the curve above due to abduction of the foot and eversion of calcaneus.",

    "In the neutral foot the area of skin immediately superficial to the TNJ will be flat.",

    "When viewed directly from behind, and in line with the long axis of the heel, the neutral foot will allow the observer to ",
    "See forefoot equally on medial and lateral sides.",
    "In the supinated foot the fore foot will adduct on the rear foot resulting more of the fore foot being visible on the medial side.",
