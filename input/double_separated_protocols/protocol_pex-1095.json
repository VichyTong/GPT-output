    "The limitation of the technique is that as and when we come across newer OBP sub-types as we mine more insect genomes, we may come across unexpected or surprising deviations from these disulphide bonds patterns by which automatic recognition of these subfamily types would be challenging, so we expect that the protocol also must be open to adapt itself to increasing knowledge that comes from merely looking at more number of insect genomes as we go by.</p><p><br></p>"
