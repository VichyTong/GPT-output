    "**PROCEDURE**",
    "**1\u2502** **Isolation of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes**",
    "Adult mouse ventricular myocytes were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. William H. Barry \\(Cardiology Division, University of Utah, Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, USA) and were isolated from 129S6 wild type mice \\(Taconic Laboratories) according to previously reported methods <sup>10</sup> \\(Note: As this protocol deals with immunocytochemisry and confocal microscopic imaging, isolation of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes is not elaborated).",
    "**2\u2502** Suspend the isolated cardiomyocytes in culture medium composed of 5% fetal bovine serum, 47.5% MEM, 47.5% modified Tyrode\u2019s solution, 10 mM pyruvic acid, 4.0 mM HEPES, and 6.1 mM glucose.",
    "Maintain the cells in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 30 \u00baC until use.",
    "**3\u2502** Label the cells with MitoTracker Deep Red 633 for staining mitochondria \\(100 nm in the culture medium, M-22426, Molecular Probes) and ",
    "Incubate for 30 min while at the CO2 incubator \u25b2CRITICAL STEP staining for mitochondria should be done in live myocytes as the MitoTracker will ",
    "Stain mitochondria only when it is alive.",
    "The concentration and timing for staining should be standardized by the end user.",
    "**4\u2502** Wash the cells with PBS twice and re",
    "Suspend in fresh PBS \u25b2CRITICAL STEP All the steps after labeling with MitoTracker should be performed in the dark or by covering the tubes containing the cells with aluminum foil to avoid photo-bleaching of the dye.",
    "**5\u2502** **Fixing and processing of cardiomyocytes for immunocytochemistry:**",
    "Pellet the isolated cardiomyocytes using low g force \\(300 g for 1 min, 30 \u00baC).",
    "Suspended the pelleted cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS maintained at 30 \u00baC and ",
    "Fix for 30 mins with gentle mixing of the contents by inverting the tube using a nutating mixer.",
    "\u25b2CRITICAL STEP  ",
    "It is important to ",
    "Maintain the cells at 30 \u00baC when they are viable and centrifuged at low g force to ",
    "Pellet cardiomyocytes, since these would affect cell viability and morphology.",
    "?",
    "Troubleshooting",
    "**6\u2502** After fixing, ",
    "Pellet down the cells \\(300 g for 1 min) and re",
    "Suspend in PBS.",
    " ",
    "7\u2502Layer the cells over chambered ",
    "Cover glass coated with Cell-Tak cell and tissue adhesive.",
    "\u25b2CRITICAL STEP Adhering the cardiomyocytes to the chambered coverglass is a difficult ",
    "Process due to its size, and it is important to ",
    "Coat the ",
    "Cover glass with a cell adhesive.",
    "**8\u2502** Leave the fixed cells layered over the chambered ",
    "Cover glass undisturbed for 2 hours at room temperature.",
    "Once the fixed cells settle to the glass surface, ",
    "Wash the non-adherent cells using PBS.",
    "**9\u2502** **Permeabilization of cardiomyocyte using Triton X-100:**",
    " Permeabilize the fixed cardiomyocytes which are adhered to the Cell Tak coated ",
    "Cover glass surface using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS \\(v/v) for 3 min at room temperature.",
    "Wash the cells with PBS \\(2 x 2 min) and ",
    "Process for immunostaining.",
    "**10\u2502** **Blocking:** Treat the permeabilized cardiomyocytes with blocking solution containing 0.01% BSA in PBS \\(w/v) for 30 mins at room temperature.",
    "\u25b2CRITICAL STEP",
    "This step helps to prevent non-specific binding of the fluorophores and is important while using primary and secondary antibodies. ",
    "**11\u2502** **Immunostaining of cardiomyocytes:** Label the fixed cells with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin for staining F-actin \\(1:40, A-12380, Molecular Probes), and SYTO 11 Green-Fluorescent Nucleic Acid ",
    "Stain for staining the nucleus \\(1: 500, S-7573, Molecular Probes) for 30 mins at room temperature in dark \u25b2CRITICAL STEP",
    "The concentration and timing for staining should be standardized by the end-user.",
    "If the cells are stained with a primary antibody, then the user has to ",
    "Incubate a secondary antibody after washing the cells with PBS \\(2 x 2 mins).",
    "The timing and concentration of the primary and secondary antibodies should be standardized by the end user.",
    "**12\u2502** After incubation with the fluorescent stains, ",
    "Wash the cells with PBS \\(3 x 3 mins) and ",
    "Maintain in PBS with antibiotics added to it.",
    "\u25a0 PAUSE POINT The chambers containing the cells can be maintained in dark at 4 \u00baC until imaged to avoid photo bleaching of the fluorophores.",
    "It is highly recommended to image the immunostained cells as soon as possible.",
    "**13\u2502** **Confocal imaging:** ",
    "Images were obtained and processed using FV300 confocal IX81 microscope \\(Olympus Microsystems) and Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope with an oil immersion objective of 60x \\(NA 1.45) at the University of Utah School of Medicine, Cell Imaging Facility, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.",
    "The excitation lasers used were Argon 488 to image nucleus stained with Syto 11, HeNe laser 543 and 633 to image F-actin stained with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin and mitochondria stained with MitoTracker Deep Red 633 respectively.",
    "Three dimensional z-projection views were obtained by deconvolution and volume rendering of the z-stacks using Olympus FluoView software and Leica Confocal Software \\(Leica Microsystems, Version 2.5, LCS Lite, Mannheim, Germany).",
    "Volume visualization of the stacks and 3D movies were generated using Voxx \\(http://www.nephrology.iupui.edu/imaging/voxx/).",
