    "For example, ",
    "Plate 1 will be aliquoted to 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- plates.  ",
    "Aliquoting is achieved by aspirating a volume of at least 80 &#x3BC;L from the source ",

    "The SPA_6 can be more efficiently screened if it is condensed to a 384 spot format on Omni Trays containing YEPD agar.",

    "The pins are dipped into the thawed 96 well plates and pinned onto the agar surface of the omni tray.  ",
    "The 12 plates \\(96 well format) are therefore condensed to 3 omni tray plates in 384 spot format.  ",
    "For example, 0-, 0+, 1-, and 1+ plates are pinned to one plate.   ",
    "Multiple copies of the omni tray plates can be made depending on the number of bait strains that are to be screened.  ",
    "Pins must be sterilized.  ",

    "A bait strain is mated to the SPA_6 prey strains.  ",
    "Diploid yeast strains expressing both of these protein fusions are selected using auxotrophic media and subsequently two-hybrid positives are selected for the activation of a reporter gene that allows their growth on the appropriate media.",

    "6.  ",
    "Pin from the diploid plates to the two-hybrid selective plates using the HDR tool.  ",
