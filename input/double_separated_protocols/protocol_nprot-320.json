    "The reaction is usually carried out at 4&#xB0;C for 16 h or at 25&#xB0;C for 4 h, with ligation efficiencies typically in the range of 40%-75% when using purified peptides possessing an N-terminal cysteine.  ",
    "This extent of ligation usually requires the synthetic peptide to be present at a final concentration of 0.5-1.0 mM. The ligation reaction is evaluated by a shift of mobility of the LPP compared to the unligated CP on a Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE.",
