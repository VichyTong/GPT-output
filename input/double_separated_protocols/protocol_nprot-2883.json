    "Plate were loaded with FNAB \\(10 \u00b5mol/50 \u00b5l methanol/well), allowed to air ",
    "Dry in the dark in a fume hood to get FNAB coated polymer surface.  ",
    "FNAB coated polymer was then exposed to UV light at a wavelength of 365 nm for 20 min.",
    "The wells were washed thrice by ethanol followed by methanol.",
    "The activated plates were dried and used further for enzyme \\(biomolecule) immobilization. ",

    "A stock solution of HRP was made in PBS \\(pH 7.2, 0.01 M).",
    "Different amounts of HRP \\(0\u201315 \u00b5g/well) were loaded into FNAB treated as well as untreated polystyrene wells and the final volume of each well was made up to 300 \u00b5l by adding buffer.",
    "The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for different time periods \\(45 min and 4 h) and then each well was washed thoroughly with washing buffer followed by the addition of substrate- dye buffer \\(300 ml/well).",
    "The absorbance was recorded at 490 nm."
