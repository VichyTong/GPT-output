    "Step 1) ",
    "Start cryoSPARC on the GPU computer. ",
    "After installation and configuration, the cryosparc command should be available in your PATH.",
    "Simply type the following at the command line \\(Figure 1):",
    "$ cryosparc start",
    "This will begin the cryosparc host processes and provide you with a web address where cryoSPARC can be used.",
    "Typically it will be http://localhost:38000",
    "Step 2) ",
    "On the GPU computer or any other computer connected to the same local network as the GPU computer, use the Google Chrome browser to navigate to the web address from step 1).",
    "You will be presented with the cryoSPARC main dashboard \\(Figure 2).",
    "Step 3) ",
    "Click on the \u2018Datasets\u2019 button in the top navigation bar to arrive at the datasets page \\(Figure 3).",
    "From here, click on \u2018New Dataset\u2019 to create a new particle dataset in cryoSPARC \\(Figure 4).",
