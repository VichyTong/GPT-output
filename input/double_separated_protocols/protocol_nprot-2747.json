    "The complex networks we envision controlling are the common case of nonlinear, dissipative dynamical systems, where the time evolution of the component dynamical variables is governed by ordinary differential equations \\(ODEs).",
    "The roles of the individual nodes and the structure of the network as a whole are assumed to be reflected in these ODEs.",
    "For example, if there is a link in the network from node _i_  to node _j_, one expects a term in the _j_-th differential equation involving the _i_-th state variable.",
    "Thus for the operational purpose of \u201ccontrol\u201d, we can completely characterize a given complex network by:",

    "\u2022 two \\(vector) functions \u201cg\u201d and \u201ch\u201d that define, respectively, the inequality and equality constraints on the eligible interventions.",
    "Note that from this point onward, we are no longer talking about NECO in the abstract, but rather in regard to its software implementation in Python.",
    "Thus f, g, and h here denote Python functions that are to be implemented by the user and in",
    "Put to _neco_.",
    "These should be regarded as distinct from the corresponding mathematical abstractions in Fig. 1, which are similarly labeled as F, g, and h \\(in Roman font) to facilitate comparison.",
    "In particular, the Python functions will generally ",
    "Take different arguments, and in a different order, than their abstract counterparts.",
    "For example, f\u2014the Python implementation of the derivatives function F\u2014can accept a number of optional parameters that are needed to compute the right-hand side of the ODEs, parameters that were omitted for notational clarity in Fig.",
    "1.",
    "Also, note that within the source code and from this point onward in this protocol, we use the letter 'y' instead of 'x' to denote the state of a dynamical system, to follow the library SciPy's notational conventions for systems of ODEs.",
    "**Defining the ODE system:**",
    "To ",
    "Apply this software to find compensatory perturbations in a given dynamical system, one needs only to supply a Python function of the form",
    "f\\(y, t, param1, param2, \u2026),",
    "which, given a system state y and optional parameters param1, param2, etc., evaluates the right-hand side of the ordinary differential equations that govern the time evolution of the system.",
    "We anticipate that the user will frequently want to use this function for other purposes, e.g., integration of system orbits for the purposes of visualization.",
    "Thus, we have intentionally required the call signature of f to ",
    "Take the form above so that it can be used with SciPy's tools for ODEs \\(in particular their numerical integrator, odeint) without modification.",
    "Note, however, that _neco_ assumes that the ODE system described by f be autonomous\u2014that is, it has no explicit time dependence.",
    "Hence, even though the time variable t appears as a required second argument, it should not actually be used within the calculation of the ",
    "Re",

    "The condition of being autonomous does not ",
    "Sacrifice any generality, since every non-autonomous system of ODEs \\(those with an explicit dependence on t) can be transformed into an equivalent autonomous system by augmenting the state space with an additional \u201cdummy\u201d variable representing t, whose time derivative is then the constant 1.",
    "Note that we impose no specific conditions on the nature of the dynamics defined by f; notably, it can contain arbitrary nonlinearities and be arbitrarily high-dimensional.",
    "The only \\(mild) requirement is that f be differentiable with respect to the system state y, so that a Jacobian matrix can be calculated.",
    "**Defining constraints on the eligible interventions:**",
    "Given the network state y0 at a particular time, one can specify the subset of network states y that are reachable through eligible perturbations from y0 using vector constraint functions of the form g\\(y) and h\\(y) for inequality and equality constraints, respectively.",
    "Each of these functions operates by taking a state y of the network and returning a NumPy array with lengths equal to the number of inequality or equality constraints, respectively.",
    "States that can be reached by eligible control perturbations are then those that satisfy g\\(y) <=  0 and h\\(y)",
    "== 0, where the inequality and equality are taken to ",
    "Apply individually to every element of the returned arrays.",
    "A common occurrence of inequality/equality constraints is one in which some dynamical variables \\(components of y) are allowed to be perturbed over a certain range and/or cannot be perturbed at all.",
    "This special case of component-wise constraints can always be expressed using g and h above, but, for convenience, we have provided the option to specify vectors of lower \\(lb) and upper \\(ub) bounds on eligible perturbed states y, which must then satisfy",
    "lb\\[i] <= y\\[i] <= ub\\[i],",
    "for every component i.",
    "This includes in particular the case in which a state variable i cannot be perturbed at all, i.e., lb\\[i] = ub\\[i] = y0\\[i]. ",
    "Each of lb, ub, g, and h is an optional keyword argument for the function _neco_.",
    "If either vector lb or vector ub is not supplied, the coordinates of the eligible states are assumed to be unbounded from below or above, respectively, before the im",
    "Position of any constraints specified by g\\(y) and/or h\\(y).",
    "Individual components can be made unbounded with respect to lb and ub by filling the appropriate positions in these vectors with the NumPy constants -inf and +inf, respectively. ",
    "**Parameters for the control procedure:**",
    "The enclosed implementation of NECO accepts a handful of parameters that govern its internal operation.",
