    "Design considerations</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>SIESTA<strong> </strong>experiments are based on parallel monitoring of protein stability changes in cell lysate aliquots treated with vehicle, enzyme, its co-substrate, or a combination of the enzyme with co-substrate.",

    "Proteins which demonstrate a specific shift in stability in samples treated with a combination of enzyme and co-substrate are considered the putative substrates of the enzyme under study.",
