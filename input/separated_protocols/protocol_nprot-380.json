    "1) Place 4.0 g of &#x3B2;-D glucosamine pentaacetate in a 250ml round bottom flask together with a Teflon coated stirrer bar.",
    "2) Dissolve 1.8 mL of propargyl alcohol in 90 mL of dichloromethane and add the freshly prepared solution to the round bottom flask with stirring.",
    "3) Add 0.96 g of Ytterbium\\(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate hydrate to the stirred mixture and equip the flask with a water cooled condenser.",
    "4) Heat the reaction mixture to refluxing on an oil bath \\(bath temperature approximately 55 &#xB0;C) and keep at this temperature for 24 hours.",
    "5) Dilute the solution with a further 50 mL of dichloromethane and transfer to a 500 mL separatory funnel.",
    "6)",
    "Wash the organic layer with two 150 mL portions of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate.",
    "7) Wash the combined aqueous phases with one 100 mL portion of dichloromethane and combine all organic layers.",
    "8) Transfer the organic layer to a 500 mL round bottom flask, dry by stirring over approximately 2.5 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 10 minutes and then remove the drying agent by suction filtration.   ",
    "9) Distil off the solvent on a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of 40 &#xB0;C.",
    "Propargyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-&#x3B2;-D-glucopyranoside",
    "10) Place a Teflon coated stirrer bar and 1.5g of propargyl 2-acetamido-3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-&#x3B2;-D-glucopyranoside \\(from step 9) in a 250ml round bottom flask.",
    "11) Add 100 mL of methanol and stir the mixture until a clear solution is obtained.",
    "12)",
    "Add 21 mg of sodium methoxide to the stirred reaction mixture and monitor the progress of the reaction by an appropriate analytical technique \\(thin-layer chromatography using ethyl acetate :methanol \\(8.5 :1.5) as eluent is recommended).",
    "13)",
    "If the reaction is not complete within 1 hour, add another portion of 10 mg of sodium methoxide to the reaction mixture.",
    "14)",
    "Once completion of the reaction has been confirmed, add strongly acidic cation exchange resin until neutral pH is reached \\(test with pH paper).",
    "15) Remove the ion exchange resin by suction filtration and distil off the solvent on a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of 40 &#xB0;C."
