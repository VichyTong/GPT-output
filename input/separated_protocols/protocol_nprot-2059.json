    "1. Collect the fibers from twenty random cottonseeds and weigh \\(W1) by XS105 DualRange \\(METTLER).\r\n  ",
    "2. Pick out six bundles of fibers \\(each around 1~2 mg) randomly from the fibers gathered. \r\n  ",
    "3. Tease each fiber bundle by hand and weigh \\(W2).\r\n  ",
    "4. Separate the ring and cap from the body of a micro-centrifuge tube \\(0.2 ml) by the knife. \r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "Fix fibers of a weighed bundle by fastening the cap to the ring.\r\n  ",
    "6. Put the bundle in boiling water for 10 min then cool it to room temperature.",
    "The treated bundle can be stored in 45% \\(v/v) acetic acid for a short-term \\(2~3 days).\r\n  ",
    "7. Dry a bundle with dust-free paper then cut in the middle region of the bundle to get three fiber segments \\(the cutting length is about 1~2 mm).\r\n  ",

    "Separate the snippets of each segments in six drops \\(each around 20 \u03bcl) of 45% \\(v/v) acetic acid by tweezers. \r\n  ",

    "10.",
    "Count the snippet number in each drop by software Image-Pro\u00ae Plus.",
    "Then the fiber number of a bundle \\(N2) can be determined \\[\\(sum of the snippet number in total 18 drops from three segments of a bundle)/3].\r\n  ",
