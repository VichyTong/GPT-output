    "The finite element analysis showed that the thickness of the prostheses was sufficient to support loads imposed on the PMMA structure.",
    "The resistance was also ensured by the safety factor (SF) attributed to the design of the thickness of the prostheses.",
    "To properly design a structure, it is necessary to restrict the stress imposed on a material to a level that is safe and stable.",
    "Thus, it is essential that the stress generated in the analyzed structure, labeled as the allowable stress (\u03c3adm), is less than the rupture stress&nbsp;of the material (\u03c3rup).",
    "Among the reasons for this relationship is the fact that the load for which the structure was designed for may be different from the actual loads applied to it.",
    "Another fact is that the projected measurements of the structure may not be exact, due to errors in manufacturing (Shigley <em>et al</em>., 2004).</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>** Figure 8 **</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A Safety Factor (SF) for the cranial prostheses was calculated considering the maximum loading applied to the model, which was 1200 N.",

    "This can lead to variations in the thickness of the prostheses in addition to specific defects, such as bubbles, which can form during the polymer curing process.",
    "The person responsible for the production of the prostheses should also ensure the homogeneity of the mixture (liquid and solid components).",
    "Such factors could influence the final resistance of the cranial prostheses.</p><p><br></p><p>",
    "According to Saura (2014), one of the requirements for materials for craniofacial bone reconstruction is that these materials shall have considerable order of magnitude in terms of mechanical resistance and deformation as the original bone.",
    "Thus, one of the reasons for choosing PMMA lies in the fact that the resistance prior to rupture is approximately 72 MPa (<strong>Table 5 \u2013 <em>Suppl.",
    "Files</em></strong>) while that of the cortical bone of the skull is in the range of 65 MPa to 130 MPa (Boruah <em>et al</em>., 2020; Ridwan- Pramana <em>et al</em>., 2016).",
    "On the other hand, the use of metal as titanium alloy prostheses with resistance of 900 MPa (Shigley <em>et al.</em>, 2004) can result in force transmission between implant and skull, at increased risk of fracture of bone tissue around the prostheses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Thickness of the cranial prostheses \u2013 \u2018bedside\u2019 (multiple episodes of TBI) <",

    "Therefore, the 4 mm-thickness is adequate to guarantee the mechanical protection of the skullcap considering the conditions imposed on the product \u2013 and also biomechanical properties similar to the bone tissue (<em>see </em><strong>Fig.",
    "12</strong>).",
