    "Overall, the laboratory methods presented in this study originate from the doctorate thesis of the author which presented novel validation of non-invasive reproductive and stress endocrine methods for amphibians.",
    "Appropriate acknowledgement has been given to suppliers of reagents and protocols referred from earlier reviews on other animals.",
    "The assays reagents were procured from the Endocrinology Laboratory, University of California, Davis, USA and provided by Dr Coralie Munro.",
    "Recent studies on amphibians using these reagents have been described in the recent author\u2019s review paper \\(Narayan 2013).   ",
    "2.1 Reproductive Steroids",
    "Concentrations of testosterone \\(T) hormone metabolites were determined in frog urine samples using a polyclonal anti-T antiserum \\(R156/7) diluted 1: 25000, horseradish peroxidase \\(HRP) - conjugated T label diluted 1: 40000 and T standards \\(0.78-200pg/well).",
    "Concentrations of estrone conjugate \\(EC) metabolites in frog urine samples were determined using a polyclonal anti-EC antiserum \\(R522-2) diluted 1: 45000, HRP-conjugated EC glucuronide label diluted 1: 45000, and EC glucuronide standards \\(0.39-100pg/well).",
    "Concentrations of progesterone \\(P) metabolites in frog urine samples were determined using a monoclonal anti-P antiserum \\(CL425) diluted 1:15 000, HRP-conjugated progesterone label diluted 1: 40000, and progesterone standards \\(0.39-100pg/well). ",
    "2.2 Corticosterone ",
    "Concentrations of urinary corticosterone were determined using a polyclonal anticorticosterone antiserum \\(CJM06) diluted 1: 45 000, horseradish peroxidase conjugated corticosterone label diluted 1: 120 000 and corticosterone standards \\(1.56\u2013400 pgwell<sup>\u20131</sup>). ",
    "2.3 General assay design ",
    "The 96 well Nunc maxi-SorpTM plates were coated with 50 \u00b5L of antibody in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA) coating buffer \\(50 mM bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and incubated for at least 12 h overnight at 4 <sup>\u25cb</sup>C. For all assays, standards, internal controls and urine samples were diluted in enzyme immunoassay buffer \\(39 mM",
    "NaH<sub>2</sub>\\(PO<sub>4</sub>)",
    "2H<sub>2</sub>O, 61 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, 15 mM NaCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0).",
    "For all assays, 50 \u00b5L of standards, internal controls and urine samples were added to each well of the coated Nunc Maxi-Sorp<sup>TM</sup> plates according to the assay plate map \\(Fig.",
    "1).",
    "About 50 \u00b5L of the corresponding horseradish peroxidase label was then added to each well, and the plates incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were washed and 50 \u00b5L of a substrate solution \\(0.01% tetramethylbenzidine and 0.004% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 M acetate citric acid buffer, pH 6.0) was added to each well.",
    "Stopping solution \\(50 \u00b5L of 0.5 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) was added based on the visual inspection of plates so that the optical density of the zero wells would read between 0.7 and 1 \\(usually after at least 10 min incubation at room temperature).",
    "Non-specific binding was accounted for by subtracting blank absorbance from each reading.",
    "Standard curves \\(Fig.",
    "2) were generated and a regression line fitted by the method of least squares and used to determine hormone metabolite concentrations in the frog urine samples. ",
    "2.4 Creatinine assay ",
    "In amphibians, urine concentration varies as a function of osmoregulation of water stored in the bladder \\(Duellman & Trueb 1994).",
    "Creatinine \\(Cr), a by-product of muscle metabolism, has been shown to be an effective measure of glomerular filtration in frogs \\(Forster 1938).",
    "It is excreted at constant rate in individuals with normal kidney function and is therefore a good index of the amount of time over which hormones have been metabolized into the urine regardless of the volume of the sample.",
    "Creatinine concentrations in frog urine were determined using the Jaffe method \\(Narayan et al. 2010a).",
    "The creatinine results were used to calculate urinary hormone metabolite concentrations in relation to urinary creatinine concentrations.",
    "All steroidal concentrations were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error \\(SE) pg/\u00b5g",
    "Cr."
