    "All the steps have to be performed at +4\u00b0C if not otherwise stated.",
    "Pre-cool all the centrifuges and rotors.",
    "An overview of the protocol is shown in Figure 1. ",
    "**Preparation of zebrafish embryos extracts**",
    "1- Collect embryos at the one-cell stage in a 35 mm Petri dish with E3 medium \\(100 embryos per condition at least).",
    "2- Place the embryos at the expected developmental stage into a pre-chilled dounce glass and add 1 ml of ice-cold MB buffer.",
    "3- Homogenize for 10 times in ice with a loose-fitting pestle by slowly stroking the pestle up and down until all embryo\u2019s chorions are removed.",
    "This step also permits to disrupt the yolk sac of the embryos.",
    "4- Let the homogenate settle on ice for 10 minutes.",
    "5- Transfer the homogenate into a pre-chilled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 300 _g_ for 5 min.",
    "6- An optional additional centrifugation step can be added.",

    "**Isolation of mitochondria**",
    "8- Disrupt the cells with a 1 mL syringe and a 26 G x 2/3 needle 50 times on ice.",
    "9- Homogenization can be checked by placing 2 \u00b5l on a microscope slide and visualizing cell lysis by phase-contrast microscopy.",
    "Few intact cells must be visible, if it is not the case re-disrupt homogenate until all the cells are lysed.",
    "10- Centrifuge cell lysate twice at 1,500 _g_ for 10 min to eliminate nuclei.",
    "11- Transfer the supernatant containing mitochondria, cytosol and microsomes into a new pre-chilled 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.",
    "12- Spin the supernatant twice at 10,600 _g_ for 10 min to pellet mitochondria \\(labeled as mito-I). ",
    "13- Remove and store supernatant on ice \\(labeled as ER-I) for endoplasmic reticulum membranes isolation.",
    "14- Gently resuspend the mito-I pellet with 1 ml of cold MB buffer. ",
    "15- Centrifuge again at 10,600 _g_ for 10 min.",
    "16- Discard the supernatant and save the pellet as mitochondria.",
    "17- Gently resuspend mitochondria in 50 \u00b5l of cold MB buffer.",
    "18- Determine the protein concentration of the sample \\(Bradford).",
    "19- Store at -20\u00b0C for further investigations \\(western blot) if not used immediately.",

    "20-",
    "Place the ER-I supernatant \\(from step 13) into a pre-chilled ultracentrifuge tube and equilibrate the rotor carefully.",
    "21- Spin at 100,000 _g_ for 1 hour at +4\u00b0C.",
    "22-",
    "The pellet is not visible so carefully discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet containing ER membrane in 50 \u00b5l of cold MB buffer.",
    "23- The amount of microsome proteins is determined \\(Bradford).",
    "24- Store at -20\u00b0C for further investigations \\(western blot) if not used immediately.",
    "**Mitochondrial calcium uptake**",
    "25- Wash twice the mitochondrial pellet mito-I \\(from step 12) with 1 ml of fresh cold KCL medium.",

    "27- Determine the amount of mitochondrial proteins \\(Bradford).",
    "28- Transfer 75 \u00b5g of proteins into a new 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and adjust volume to 1 ml with KCL medium.",
    "29- Centrifuge 10 min at 10,600 _",
    "g_",
    "at +4\u00b0C.",

    "OregonGreen 5N.",
    "31- Transfer all the volume in a well of a black 96-well plate with flat and transparent bottom.",
    "32- OregonGreen 5N fluorescence intensity is measured using a Mithras LB 940 multimode microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 510 nm. ",
    "33- Fluorescence intensity is measured every 2 s for 5 min.",
    "34- After 30 s measurement, 20 \u00b5l of KCL buffer supplemented with 200 \u00b5M CaCl<sub>2</sub> is injected \\(final concentration of CaCl<sub>2</sub> 20 \u00b5M).",
    "35- The decrease of fluorescence intensity following the peak induced by CaCl<sub>2</sub> injection is representative of the mitochondrial calcium uptake."
