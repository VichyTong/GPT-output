    "The following Procedure assumes knowledge of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.",
    "For more information on patch-clamping, see for example \u2018Microelectrode Techniques: The Plymouth Workshop Handbook\u2019, Ed. D. Ogden.",
    "1. Confine a honeybee or bumblebee in a 50 ml tube and place in a container of ice until anaesthetised \\(approx.",
    "5-10 mins, generally bumblebees require longer than honeybees).\r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "Using a dissecting microscope \\(at low magnification), remove the head with a scalpel.",
    "Discard the body.\r\n  ",
    "3. Pin the head, neck side up, in the petri dish containing Sylgard.",
    "Pin via the head capsule through both sides of the mouthparts.\r\n  ",
    "4.",
    "Using a fine scalpel, cut all the way around the top of the head capsule, and slide the scalpel underneath to sever the neck parts. \r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "Using forceps, remove the cut piece of head capsule and moisten the exposed brain with a drop of extracellular solution.\r\n  ",
    "6. Transfer the head to a 3.5 cm petri dish lid containing extracellular solution.\r\n  ",
    "7. Place the head with the exposed brain upwards and use a fine scalpel to cut away the mouthparts.\r\n  8.",
    "Holding the side of the head capsule with a pair of forceps, gently tease the brain away from the head capsule with the side of a fine scalpel and remove the brain. \r\n  ",
    "9.",
    "Under higher magnification, while stabilising the brain using a curved pair of forceps \\(upside-down), remove the surrounding visible membranes and glands.",
    "They are generally identifiable by texture and colour and separate easily from the brain.",
    "Also remove the ocelli if they do not come away with the outer membrane.",
    "The mushroom body calyces should be visible at this point.\r\n  ",
    "10.",
    "Transfer the brain using the suction pipette to a 1 ml eppendorf containing the digesting enzyme solution.",
    "Agitate a little and leave for 5 minutes \\(honeybees) or 10 minutes \\(bumblebees).\r\n  ",
    "11.",
    "Transfer back to the extracellular solution to rinse off the enzyme solution, then to another 3.5 cm petri dish containing fresh extracellular solution.\r\n  ",
    "12.",
    "Under high magnification, use a fine pair of forceps to remove more of the membrane overlying the mushroom body calyces. \r\n  ",
    "13.",
    "If desired hemisect the brain using a fine scalpel, and transfer to the recording chamber.",
    "Secure using a cross-haired weight that rests across the optic lobe and central part of the brain but does not obscure the mushroom bodies.\r\n  ",
    "14.",
    "Transfer to the rig microscope stage and start the flow of extracellular solution.\r\n  ",
    "15.  ",
    "Locate the mushroom bodies and, by viewing on a monitor under high magnification \\(> x600), inspect the KCs.",
    "It should be possible to identify the non-compact, inner compact and outer compact populations of KCs \\(17).",
    "Identify a cell body that is readily accessible and free of overlying membrane for patch-clamping.\r\n  16.",
    "If using, position a micropipette for local application of receptor agonist, etc.\r\n  17.",
    "Position the patch-pipette \\(~8 M\u03a9) near the KC, with positive pressure applied.",
    "After making good contact with the cell membrane, release the pressure; the seal should form immediately, ideally without the need for further suction.  \r\n  ",
    "18.",
    "Set the required membrane potential, wait if necessary for the seal to improve \\(to < -10 pA at -60 mV), and break-in by applying constant, gentle negative pressure.\r\n  ",
    "19.",
    "Check the passive and active membrane properties of the KC \\(13); if acceptable proceed with the experiment."
