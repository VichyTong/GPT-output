    "Compared to the aliphatic backbone based gelators such as amino acid,<sup>19</sup> sugar,<sup>20</sup> steroids,<sup>21</sup> two-component mixtures<sup>22</sup> _etc._, aromatic based gelators like oligo-p-phenylenevinylenes<sup>18,23-26</sup> are more effective as they include \u03c0-stacking interactions along with the regular hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals, dipolar and electrostatic interactions.",
    "Due to such non-covalent interactions between gelator-gelator and gelator-solvent, the gelator molecules build up a supramolecular ensemble which has the ability to immobilize the whole system.<sup>27</sup>",

    "The gelation was retained even after several consecutive heating and cooling cycles \\(from room temperature to 70 <sup>o</sup>C) while the pheromone did not undergo any decomposition as observed under the GC-MS studies.",
    "The gel-melting temperature at 63 <sup>o</sup>C \\(12 mg/mL of the gelator) provides the thermal stability of the sample which is adequate for the agricultural field trials even in hot climates around different geographical regions of the world.",
