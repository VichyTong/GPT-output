    "**Preparation of high-titer Cre-loxP controlled lentiviral vectors, Tomo LVs**",
    "1.",
    "Tomo LVs are produced as described previously <sup>6</sup>.",
    "At the final step, the viruses are dissolved in HBSS solution.",
    "The biological titer of lentiviral vectors was determined by the infection of HeLa cells with different virus dilutions.",
    "Usually viruses of 1.0 x 10<sup>8</sup> &#x2013; 10<sup>9</sup> IU are used.",
    "For the GBM model, we mix equal amounts of Tomo H-Ras LVs and Tomo AKT LVs.",
    "Please see Marumoto et al. about the details of Cre-loxP controlled lentiviral vectors, Tomo LVs.\r\n  ",
    "TIP:",
    "It is important that the virus solution is stored in small aliquots at &#x2013;80&#xBA;C. Virus solution can be stored at -80&#xBA;C for at least 1 year without significant change in virus titer.",
    "Do not re-freeze virus solution after thawing.",
    "The virus solution can be stored at 4&#xBA;C if an experiment is planned within a week.",
    "Caution: Lentiviruses are capable of infecting human cells including nondividing cells through contact.",
    "Gloves and protective clothing are required for working with lentiviruses.",
    "Extra caution should be taken to avoid spill and splash when handling lentivirus-containing material.",
    "Lentiviruses are labile and easily decontaminated by ethanol, detergent or bleach.",
    "Working area should be decontaminated with ethanol or bleach after any spill or after the completion of work. ",
    "**Injection of lentiviral vectors into the hippocampus, subventricular zone and cortex**",
    "2.",
    "Inject anesthetics into the intraperitoneal cavity of 8&#x2013;16 week-old GFAP-Cre/p53+/- mice.",
    "Wait for 5 min so that the mice do not respond to pinching with tweezers.\r\n  ",
    "Caution:",
    "All animal experiments are to be performed in accordance with relevant authorities&#x2019; guidelines and regulations.",
    "3. Shave a small area on the head with a trimmer.",
    "Apply eye ointment \\(Pura lube Vet Ointment) to prevent eyes from over-drying.",
    "Sterilize the scalp with povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol.\r\n  ",
    "4. Cut the scalp about 1cm.",
    "Wipe blood from the wound with clean cotton tips.\r\n  ",
    "5. Mount the mouse onto a stereotaxic frame.\r\n  ",
    "TIP:",
    "Orienting the head straight in terms of the antero-posterior axis and horizontally is important for consistent injection into the target area.",
    "6. Move the tip of injection needle to the bregma.\r\n  ",
    "7. Move the needle tip to 1.5mm lateral and 2.0mm posterior for the injection into the hippocampus \\(dentate gyrus), 2.0mm lateral and 1.5mm posterior for the injection into the subventricular zone, and 2.0mm lateral and 1.0mm anterior for the injection into the cortex.",
    "Mark the position with a marker pen.",
    "The stereotaxic coordinate shown here is for 8&#x2013;16 week-old GFAP-Cre/p53+/- mice and C57Bl/6 mice used by Marumoto et al..",
    "The coordinates need to be adjusted according to the line and age of mice used for each study.\r\n  ",
    "8. Move the needle out and make a small hole on the skull using an electric drill.\r\n  ",
    "Caution: Be careful to avoid the damage to the brain tissues.",
    "9.",
    "Dip the needle tip into virus solution and load 0.8&#x3BC;l of solution into the syringe.\r\n  ",
    "10.",
    "Move the needle tip to the hole and set it to the level of skull surface.\r\n  ",
    "11.",
    "Move the needle tip down by 2.3mm for the hippocampus injection and the subventricular injection, and 1.0mm for the cortex injection.\r\n  ",
    "12.",
    "Inject a total of 0.8&#xB5;l of virus solution very slowly \\(0.1&#xB5;l/30s) to avoid the damage to the normal brain tissues.\r\n  ",
    "13.",
    "After finishing with the injection, wait for 5min to prevent the injected solution from flowing back through the needle track.\r\n  ",
    "14.",
    "Move the needle tip up very slowly until it comes out of the brain.\r\n  ",
    "15.",
    "Close the skin with tissue glue or by sewing with 4-0 nylon thread.",
    "Place the mouse in a cage on top of a warm blanket until it is fully alert.",
    "Transfer the mouse back to home cage.\r\n  ",
    "16.",
    "Observe the mice injected with Tomo LVs until they show symptoms indicating brain tumor formation such as walking disturbance and dehydration.",
    "Non-invasive in vivo imaging of GFP expressing GBM is shown in Fig.1."
