    "REAGENT SETUP",
    "Reconstitute the reagent to be delivered according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and store at 4 \u00b0C or -20 \u00b0C",
    "CAUTION:",
    "Dilution of the reagent should be performed under sterile conditions to exclude possible contaminations.",
    "Prepare aliquots if necessary.",
    "Intended delivery amount depends on the corresponding antibody or cytokine.",
    "The appropriate concentration of the substance to be applied to the mouse depends on its biological effects.",
    "Generally speaking, the sufficient concentration of the antibody depends on the number of cells per lung \\(see Sauer et al. and Maxeiner et al.11,12) and the concentration of antibodies that is required to neutralize the amount of cytokine released by such cells.",
    "Intended delivery volume: 25-50 \u00b5l PBS per mouse. ",
    "After dilution the reagent can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for a few hours.",
    "However, it is advisable to prepare the dilution directly before usage.",
    "It is also advisable to let the reagent warm to room temperature before application.",
    "Anaesthesia:",
    "o Isoflurane \\(ready to use solution).",
    "o Avertin \\(prepare according to MATERIALS, Alternative I)",
    "o Ketamine \\(prepare according to MATERIALS, Alternative II)",
    "PROCEDURE ",
    "Box 1:",
    "Protocol to treat mice while developing asthma \\(therapy).",
    "Mice are organized in cages in accordance to the different groups as indicated in Figure 1a.",
    "Mice within the asthma untreated and treated groups received 200\u00b5l of OVA complexed with alum \\(OVA/alum) i.p.",
    "on days 0 and 7.",
    "The control group received instead PBS complexed with alum at the same time points.",
    "Eight days after sensitization the mice were treated i.n.",
    "with 25-50\u00b5l of OVA \\(asthma untreated and treated groups) or PBS \\(control group) on days 25, 26 and 27.",
    "Alternatively, mice can also be treated with OVA or PBS as aerosol.",
    "Additionally, the asthma treated group received i.n. 25-50\u00b5l of the indicated treatment \\(for example \uf061IL-6R) 30 minutes to 2 h prior to the allergen challenge \\(days 25-27).",
    "At day 28 AHR measurements are performed followed by BALF and lung cell suspension as previously described12-13.",
    "Note: OVA/alum complex preparation: To weigh 5 mg of Ovalbumin and dispense it in 10 ml 0.9% NaCl and 1g of Aluminium potassium sulphate \\(alum) dispense it in 10 ml of distilled water.",
    "Then pipette the alum to the OVA and set the pH-value to 6.5 by adding NaOH.",
    "Afterwards the solution has to incubate for 1h at room temperature with gentle shaking.",
    "Centrifuge the OVA/alum for 5 min, 1500 rpm at 4\u00b0C and discard the supernatant.",
    "Add Aqua dest.",
    "ad 10 ml and resuspend the OVA/alum solution well. ",
    "The OVA/alum solution should be used the same day or stored at 4\u00b0C and used the next day.",
    "\\(Figure 1b).",
    "It is always advisable to test substances of interest in vitro in cell culture experiments before applying them into the mice in order to check their efficiency for the desired application.",
    "1 Dilute the reagent to appropriate concentration as described in REAGENT SETUP and store on ice.",
    "2 Anaesthetize the mouse with Isoflurane for 30 sec to one minute by putting it into the mouse box of the equipment \\(Figure 2a).",
    "Critical step: It is important to use the equipment according to the respective instructions to avoid harm to the mouse.",
    "Take the animal out of the mouse box as soon as it does not move anymore and its breathing has slowed down slightly.",
    "The timing is extremely critical as this is essential for successful application of the reagent to the mouse.",
    "If anaesthesia is not deep enough the mouse might wake up while still applying the reagent which leads to loss of the reagent and thus incomplete physiological effects.",
    "3 Take 25-50 \u00b5l of the solution into a pipette.",
    "Critical step: Do not use more than 50 \u00b5l for intranasal application as this will decrease the efficiency of the delivery and may be dangerous for the mouse. ",
    "4 Take the mouse out of the mouse box and hold it in the neck, to stabilize the head.",
    "Fix the tail with the fingers.",
    "Bend the head back slightly to keep the respiratory passages clear and remove respiratory obstructions.",
    "5 Immediately pipette the solution carefully and slowly directly onto the nose of the mouse.",
    "Put it back into the cage. ",
    "CAUTION:",
    "Make sure that the mouse is awake and well after the procedure",
    "6",
    "At the end of the experiment \\(Figure 1a) mice are sacrificed and the lungs are removed and analysed as shown in Sauer et al. and Maxeiner et al 11,12.",
    "At this point it is also possible to measure airway hyperreativity and take blood samples as well as perform a broncho-alveolar lavage.",
    "For anticipated results see Figures 2 and 3.",
    "TIMING: ca. 5 minutes"
