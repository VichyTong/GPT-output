    "Adjust to a suitable concentration, e.g. 4x10<sup>6</sup>/ml.\r\n  ",

    "4. Mix on ice 1125\u00b5l Matrigel + 125\u00b5l tumour cells \\(i.e.",

    "Inject, subcutaneously, carefully 250\u00b5l ice-cold tumour cell/Matrigel solution using a 1ml syringe with a 0.6mm x 25mm needle \\(This will give 10<sup>5</sup> cancer cells per Matrigel plug if the original concentration was 4 x 10<sup>6</sup>/ml).\r\n  ",

    "**Note:**",
    "During the whole procedure, keep samples on ice as much as possible.",

    "From each mouse, dissect carefully the Matrigel plug and transfer it into a 50ml tube with 1ml cell medium RPMI1640 supplemented with 0.3mg/ml DNase and 1mg/ml collagenase IV.\r\n  3.",
    "Cut the Matrigel plug in small pieces using sterile scissors. \r\n  ",
    "4. Put sample on ice.\r\n  ",
    "5. Clean dissection equipment and scissors between each mouse.\r\n  ",
    "6.",
    "Go back to step two until all Matrigel plugs are collected. \r\n  ",
    "7. Place the tubes in a water bath for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C.\r\n  8.",

    "14.",
    "Filter the supernatant through a 0.45\u00b5m filter.\r\n  ",

    "Aliquot the samples in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes \\(e.g.",
    "50\u00b5l per tube).",
    "Freeze immediately at -70\u00b0 C or below and keep samples frozen until analysis with ELISA or luminex technology. \r\n  ",
    "**Note:**",
    "After incubation I _step 7_, you will still observe some Matrigel clumps in the sample.",
    "These clumps are easily meshed through the stainless sieve.",
    "After meshing \\(_step 9_)",
    "you will loose the rest of the Matrigel collagen fibers in centrifugation \\(_step 11_) and filtering \\(_step14_).",
    "Cytokines in Matrigel extracellular matrix are diluted approximately five times in _step 2_ \\(1ml RPMI + ~250\u00b5l Matrigel plug).",
    "Final concentration is therefore found by multiplying observed concentration with 5.  ",
    "A starting volume of 1ml RPMI + Matrigel plug will typically give 400-700\u00b5l filtered supernatant."
