    "The RBC lysis by bacterial hemolysin is measured as described<sub>1</sub> with modification. ",
    "1.",
    "Collect the RBCs into heparinized tubes. \r\n  ",
    "2. Wash the RBC two times by gentle resuspension with 10 times volume of pyrogen free saline \\(0.9% NaCl), and centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. \r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "Gently resuspend the RBC pellet with pyrogen free saline and dilute the RBC to 0.8% \\(v/v).  \r\n  ",
    "4. Culture the bacteria under test according to protocol #4, and adjust the population to 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml. \r\n  ",
    "5. Incubate the washed RBC with equal volume of bacteria at room temperature under steady rotation at 6 rpm. \r\n  ",
    "6. Set up pyrogen-free saline \\(0.9%) as the negative control, and 1% Triton-X100 in saline as the positive control.  \r\n  ",
    "7.",
    "At time intervals, retrieve aliquots of the reaction mixture and pellet the RBC by centrifuging at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. \r\n  ",
    "8. Transfer the supernatant into 96 well microtitre plate.  ",
    "Monitor the absorbance at 404 nm with ELISA-reader as an indication of the hemoglobin released into the supernatant."
