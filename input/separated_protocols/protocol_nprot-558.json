    "Euthanize the mice using carbon dioxide and according to guidelines from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of BSRC &#x201C;Alexander Fleming&#x201D;. \r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "Rinse microdissecting instruments with 70% Ethanol and then immerse them in an antimicrobial for a few seconds.",
    "**\\!CRITICAL STEP** Repeat the decontamination step of the instruments after cutting off the joints of each mouse.\r\n  ",
    "3. Place the mouse in the face-up position and rinse it with 100% Ethanol.\r\n  ",
    "4. Peel back the skin and remove soft tissues from the hind legs using scissors and forceps.",
    "**\\!CRITICAL STEP** Be careful not to leave any remaining skin covering the toes.\r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "Cut ankle joint off before the tibial muscle including the toes, and spray again with 100% ethanol.\r\n  ",
    "6. Place ankle joints in a tube filled with HBSS and antibiotics.",
    "Repeat steps 4-6 for all joints.",
    "**\\!CRITICAL STEP**",
    "From this step on work should be done in a laminar flow hood.\r\n  ",
    "7. Place the cut joints into a 100mm tissue culture plate containing 70% ETOH, for some seconds, and then transfer them to an HBSS-containing dish.\r\n  ",
    "8.",
    "Place one joint in a fresh empty 100mm dish and cut through the joint space with the scalpel.",
    "Hold each toe digit with the scalpel and pull with the forceps.",
    "**\\!CRITICAL STEP**",
    "Avoid smashing the bones so as to prevent contamination by bone marrow cells.\r\n  ",
    "9.",
    "Repeat steps 8-9 for all joints.\r\n  ",

    "Add 18ml DMEM 10% FCS to the plate containing the processed tissue from 3 mice.\r\n  12.",

    "Incubate tissues with collagenase solution in the shaking water bath at 37 &#xB0;C for 50min to 1h, at maximum shaking speed.",
    "**\\!CRITICAL STEP**",
    "Adjust the time of collagenase digestion according to the enzymatic activity of the lot used.",
    "The range of activity of batches used in standardization of this protocol was between 450-600 units/mg. \r\n  14.",
    "Following completion of incubation time, vortex vigorously to release cells.\r\n  ",
    "15.",
    "Transfer supernatant to a new 50ml tube.",
    "Place 20ml of fresh DMEM in the tube containing the digested joints.",
    "Repeat the procedure and add the supernatant to the new tube.\r\n  ",

    "Seed tissues/cells into 100mm dishes \\(dissected tissue from 1 mouse into one 100mm plate or 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask) and place in a humidified tissue culture incubator \\(37 &#xB0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).\r\n  ",
    "**TIMING: 2.0-2.5h \\(although it might be shorter if cells from less than 6 mice are isolated).",

    "Monitor isolated cells daily, and change medium every 3 days **\\!CRITICAL STEP**",
    "Be careful not to remove the small pieces of tissue during the first 1 week after isolation.\r\n  ",
    "20.",
    "Once groups of cells are observed, remove the floating pieces of tissue.\r\n  ",
    "21.",
    "Trypsinize when confluence reaches 90-100% of the plate and transfer to a 150mm plate \\(or 175cm<sup>2</sup> flask) \\(split 1:2).",
    "Usually cells reach confluency 7-10 days after isolation.",
    "After first passage, confluency is reached 3-4 days later.",
    "**\\!CRITICAL STEP** Avoid long incubations with Trypsin \\(2-4 min incubation with pre-warmed trypsin is effective for fibroblast detachment whereas macrophages that are highly adhesive will remain attached.",
    "Thus, it is highly recommended to change flasks/plates in every passage)."
