    "Keep stirring the mixture with a stir bar till it turned orange without distinct precipitation. \r\n  ",
    "CAUTION",
    "If the reactants added into the ethylene glycol cannot be dispersed easily, ultrasonic treatment on the mixture for 10 min or even longer would help.",
    "3. 3.6 g Sodium acetate was added into the mixture until the iron source was totally dissolved and the suspension became dark brown.\r\n  ",
    "4. Appropriate amount of diallyl sulfide was added into the mixture during the mixing process respectively.\r\n  ",
    "CAUTION Owing to the pungent smell of DADS, the whole process was performed in the fume cupboard and the beaker dissolved with mixed solution need to be covered by plastic wrap.",
    "5.",
    "The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave in the fume cupboard after being sufficiently stirred and sonicated.\r\n  ",
    "CAUTION",
