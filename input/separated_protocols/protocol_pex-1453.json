    "Aside from sampling artefact, the larger purpose of this is to attempt to distinguish between those microbial agents that are infectious to the bee tissues, and are therefore a potential health threat; those that are part of the bee microbiome, both internal and external, and those that are passively associated with the bee but not infectious to bee tissues.",
    "We have therefore also included several simple processing and assay strategies that maximize our ability to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious agents.",
    "One means to do this is to separate the body parts of the bees:</p><p><strong><u>Abdomen</u></strong><u>,</u> where nearly all internal bee pathogens replicate, in the bee tissues, and shed their</p><p>replicative propagules (spores/oocysts/virus particles <em>etc.</em>) in the gut lumen for voiding into the</p><p>environment, with the faeces.",
    "The abdomen also contains passively acquired, non-infectious</p><p>agents, both internally in the gut and externally on the exoskeleton.</p><p><strong><u>Head</u></strong><u>,</u> where many of the viral pathogens actively replicate, and occasionally shed particles into the</p><p>salivary and hypopharyngeal glands, especially in honey bees.</p><p><strong><u>Thorax</u></strong><u>,</u> containing few internal (or external) microbes.</p><p><strong><u>Wings &amp; Legs</u></strong><u>,</u> containing pollen baskets.",
    "Pathogens can be shared between bees through flower-</p><p>visitor networks, especially on pollen.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the abdomen contains by far the highest concentrations of pathogens, there is little loss of detection sensitivity from excluding the head, thorax and legs-wings, which can be retained separately for other studies.",
    "For example, the DNA/RNA from legs, wings and thoraxes contain very little contaminating microbial nucleic acids and are therefore optimally suited for possible host bee genetic analyses.",
    "In order to allow for the widest possible types of additional, future analyses on the material, it is best to prepare the primary homogenate in a neutral, aqueous buffer and only extract RNA and DNA from an aliquot of primary homogenate, with the remainder stored at -80 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C. There is no loss in detection sensitivity of the pathogens (or host mRNAs) from such a neutral primary extract <u>as long as the extract is either frozen or added to the nucleic acid extraction buffers within 5 minutes.</u>",

    "The presence and abundance of a range of bee microorganisms, whether detrimental or beneficial, is determined by quantitative PCR of the cDNA and DNA templates using broad-range primers (<em>i.e.</em> those encompassing several strains or species within a complex).",
    "The reason for this is in part efficiency (fewer assays to run) and in part to avoid false negative results due to assay insufficiencies (Type-II errors).",
    "Type-I errors (false positive results) are mostly due to trace contamination and are easily avoided by restricting the number of amplification cycles to 35, rather than 40<sup>17,42,51</sup> For accurate quantification we recommend buying synthetic external quantification standards (<em>e.g.</em>",
    "ThermoFisher), based on the product sequences (Supplementary Information 3), rather than home-made standards from either purified plasmid clones of the fragment, or purified PCR product, primarily to guarantee uniformity of standards and quantification between different labs, as well as better absolute quantification with synthetically produced, and accurately quantified, standards.",
    "A key element of these quantitative assays is the use of the passive external reference nucleic acids, RNA250 and pJET1.2.",
    "These were added in exact known quantities at the start of the homogenization and nucleic acid extraction protocol and the amounts of these left in each cDNA and DNA template can be measured exactly through qPCR, similar to how the pathogen amounts are measured.",

    "It will reduce, if not eliminate, random methodological noise from the dataset and improve the chances of detecting true biological differences between the samples.",
