    "1) Pellet cells and resuspend in 1 mL of Trizol \\(I have difficulty isolating quality RNA from less than 1 X 10<sup>6</sup> primary T cells).",
    "1 mL of Trizol can be used for 1 X 10<sup>6</sup> to 10 X 10<sup>6</sup>.  ",
    "It is best to brush the pelleted cells along a rack to dislodge them from the bottom of the tube.",
    "Sometimes aggregates will still be visible.",
    "Do not resuspend.",
    "2) Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes",
    "3) Add 200&#x3BC;L of Chloroform using a barrier pipette tip and shake each sample vigourously",
    "4) Incubate at room temperature for 3 minutes",
    "5) Centrifuge at 12000g for 15 minutes at 4&#xB0;C",
    "6) Transfer upper aqueous phase into a new RNAase free tube \\(approximately 0.8-1 mL of volume)",
    "7) Add 0.5 mL of isopropanol/mL of Trizol used and shake vigourously ",
    "8) Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes",
    "9) Centrifuge at 12000g for 15 minutes at 4&#xB0;C",
    "10) Pour off supernantant and wash pellet in with 1 mL of 75% ethanol \\( do not resuspend pellet rather squirt in ethanol",
    "so the pellet becomes dislodged from the bottom of tube)",
    "11)  ",
    "Centrifuge at 12000g for 5 minutes at room temperature",
    "12) Pour off supernantant and briefly dry pellet \\(can use a 10&#x3BC;L pipette or a kimwipe corner to get rid of residual ethanol)",
    "13) Dissolve pellet in 30&#x3BC;L of DepC treated water and place at 55&#xB0;C for 5-10 minutes.",
    "14) Spec and take 2&#x3BC;g for cDNA conversion.",
    "Store the rest of the RNA at -80&#xB0;C."
