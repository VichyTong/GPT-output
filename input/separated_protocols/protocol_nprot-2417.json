    "TIMING ~2 h ",
    "1.",
    "Add PEG \\(50 g) \\(1 kDa, 3 kDa, 10 kDa, or 35 kDa depending on the synthesis plan) and toluene \\(200 mL) into a one-necked round-bottomed flask \\(1 L) \\(Figure 1).\r\n  ",
    "CAUTION Toluene is irritating and/or harmful if exposed to the skin or inhaled.",
    "Conduct all work in a chemical fume hood.",
    "Proper personal protective equipment \\(lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses) should be worn throughout the procedure.",
    "2. Stir the mixture using a magnetic stir bar.\r\n  ",
    "3. Heat the reaction flask to 170\u00b0C using a heating mantle.\r\n  ",
    "4. Measure the distillate using the Barrett distilling receiver and collect the distillate into a 250 mL beaker for disposal.\r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "Continue heating until 180 mL distillate has been collected.\r\n  ",
    "6.",
    "Once the desired amount of distillate has been collected, cool the reaction flask to room temperature and collect any subsequent distillate.\r\n  ",
    "PAUSE POINT Once cooled, the reaction flask may be sealed and stored in the fume hood until the anhydrous PEG is needed."
