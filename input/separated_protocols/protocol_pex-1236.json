    "Guideline Development:</p><p>In March 27, 2020, the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) in conjunction with ID providers outlined recommendations regarding when to initiate antibiotics for possible bacterial pneumonia and when to discontinue empiric antibiotics among patients with COVID-19.",
    "These recommendations were incorporated into the institution\u2019s inpatient COVID-19 management guideline.",
    "&nbsp;Indications to initiate empiric antibiotics for CABP included the presence of leukocytosis, fever, or chest imaging suggestive of a bacterial process.&nbsp;The guideline also included recommendations for ordering a respiratory bacterial</p><p>&nbsp;and viral panel (RBVP; Biofire Diagnostics FilmArray\u00ae respiratory Panel, Biomerieux, Salt Lake City, UT), a <em>Legionella</em> urinary antigen, and a <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>urinary antigen.&nbsp;Discontinuation of atypical coverage (e.g. azithromycin, doxycycline, or levofloxacin) was recommended in patients with a negative <em>Legionella </em>urinary antigen and a RBVP negative for atypical bacterial pathogens.&nbsp;Additionally, discontinuation of antibiotics prescribed for CABP (e.g. ceftriaxone or cefdinir) was recommended in patients with negative RBVPs for non-atypical bacterial pathogens and a negative <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> urinary antigen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(2)",
    "Guideline Implementation: </p><p>Throughout the study period, recommendations and education regarding antibiotic use among COVID-19 inpatients were given to COVID unit providers during daily virtual rounds with the ID COVID-19 Consult Service.",
    "Education was also provided to emergency department (ED)",
    "staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;All admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19 received an automatic ID consult for evaluation of antibiotic therapy in addition to COVID-specific management.",
    "Each ID consult team included an ID/ASP pharmacist who, along with the ID providers, evaluated each patient case.",
    "After updating the institution\u2019s guideline to include recommendations for CABP, this evaluation also included a standardized and targeted stewardship intervention to recommend obtaining an RVBP, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> urinary antigen and/or <em>Legionella </em>urinary antigen (if not performed on admission), along with recommendations to discontinue or de-escalate antibiotics for CABP, in accordance with the institutional guideline.",
