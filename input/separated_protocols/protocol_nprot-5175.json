    "This is taken as the day 0 of differentiation. \r\n  ",
    "**TIP**:  Do not move the plate for 3 days in the incubator.",
    "This will improve the formation of EBs.",
    "3. Change the hiPSC growth medium without FGF2 at day 3 and then change the medium daily to day 10. \r\n  ",
    "**TIP**: To change the medium, collect the medium containing EBs in a 15 ml conical tube.",
    "Leave the tube 15 minutes under the hood for allowing EBs to sediment at the bottom of the tube by gravity.",
    "A short spin of the tubes at a low speed \\(10 sec at 800g) may increase the number of EBs collected.",
    "Remove gently the supernatant, add fresh medium and seed EBs back on the 6-well-ultra-low attachment plates.",
