    " ",
    "Evacuate the closed vials as follows:",
    "Insert the needle into the tube and fix both at the outlet of the vacuum pump.",
    "Insert the needle into the middle of the butyl stopper of the vial and let the pump run until the vial is completely evacuated \\(it takes one to two minutes, depending on the pump\u2019s capacity).",
    "The evacuation has succeeded well if the butyl stopper indents a little.",
    " ",
    "Label the evacuated vials with symbols enable you to distinguish between the blind sample \\(v<sub>B</sub>), ambient air \\(v<sub>AA</sub>) and equilibrated air \\(v<sub>EA</sub>). ",
    "TIMING:",

    "**SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS**",

    "The descriptive information can be a help when it comes to interpreting the data.",
    " ",
    "Sample the control.",
    "To this end, inject 10 ml of a CO<sub>2</sub>-free gas \\(nitrogen) or standard gas in v<sub>B</sub> using the 60 ml syringe.",
    "The gas enters the vial automatically if the evacuation was performed correctly.",
    "Since it is impossible to evacuate a vial completely a control measurement has to be taken for the background correction. ",
    " ",
    "Take a 10 ml sample of ambient air directly over the water surface and inject it into v<sub>AA</sub>. ",
    "As an alternative, artificial air free of CO<sub>2</sub> \\(nitrogen or from a scrubber) can be used instead of ambient air.",
    "In the latter case the results from v<sub>AA</sub> should be the same as those from v<sub>B</sub>. ",
    " ",
    "Now the main sampling takes place:",
    "Fill the syringe with 40 ml water.",
    "Create a headspace in the syringe by sampling 20 ml of ambient air.",
    "As an alternative, CO<sub>2</sub>-free air can be used to create the headspace.",
    "Equilibrate both phases by shaking the syringe for 1 minute under the water surface.",
    "Since the saturation of the water and hence the amount of gas that drifts into the gas phase are dependent on the temperature it is important that the equilibration is done at water temperature and therefore below the surface.",
    "This could make a significant difference where springs are sampled during the summer, for instance.",
    "The temperature of the spring might be below 10\u00b0C whilst the air temperature is around 30\u00b0C.",
    "Also, if the sample is shaken in the air, the temperature of the sampler\u2019s hand could affect the temperature of the solvent and thus the equilibration of both phases. ",

    "Inject the remaining equilibrated gas into v<sub>EA</sub>. ",

    "Store all vials at approximately 6\u00b0C until further analysis can take place.",
    "Analyses should be done within 48 hours, especially where higher concentrations are expected <sup>4</sup>. ",
    "Subsequent gas analyses can be performed using an infrared gas analyzer or headspace gas chromatography.",
    "The choice of device \\(for instance the detector) depends on the one hand on the laboratory equipment and on the other hand on the anticipated concentration.   ",
    "**TIMING:**",
    "The sampling procedure takes approximately 10 minutes for 3 samples, including registration of  environmental parameters.",
    "Since different protocols exist on how CO<sub>2</sub> should be analyzed, the analysis itself can take 5 to 15 minutes per sample.",
    "The time needed for calibration and the instrument\u2019s warm-up time are not taken into consideration.",

    "1. Correct the concentrations \\(ppmv) of ambient air \\(C<sub>AA</sub>) and equilibrated air \\(C<sub>EA</sub>) for background concentration by subtracting C<sub>B</sub>.",
    "If several samples are taken it is necessary to determine the mean of a suitable number of blind samples.",
    "Before doing this, discard obvious outliers and calculate the mean, and use this as the correction factor for all samples.",
    "The standard deviation can be used for subsequent sensitivity analysis, if required. \r\n  ",
    " ",
    "2. **Multiply the resulting C<sub>EA</sub> by 2**.",

    "According to the ideal gas law, the concentration of C<sub>EA</sub> was thus halved, and this needs to be compensated by doubling the value.",
