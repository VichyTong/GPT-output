    "1. MDA-MB-468 human breast adenocarcinoma epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium \\(GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum \\(FBS, GIBCO) in incubator supplied with 5% carbon dioxide humidified air at 37 \u00b0C.\r\n  ",
    "2. Seed the healthy cells on the coverslips in each well of a 24-well plate at about 60% density, then incubate overnight.\r\n  ",
    "3. Suck off the culture medium, add 500 \u03bcL DMEM containing 100 \u03bcM **2** or **2-Scr** \\(mix 5 \u03bcL of PBS stock solution of **2** or **2-Scr** at 10 mM with 495 \u03bcL DMEM)  into different each well respectively, then incubate for 8 h.\r\n  4.",
    "Suck off the medium, wash the cells with PBS for three times at room temperature.\r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "Add 500 \u03bcL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS into each well to fix the cells at room temperature for 30 min, wash the cells with PBS a further three times.\r\n  ",
    "6.",
    "Drop 1 \u03bcL of 50% glycerol PBS solution on a glass slide and then pick up the coverslip in 24-well plate, mount the coverslip on the glycerol drop with the cells facing to the glass slide, fix the edges of coverslip with glass slide using nail enamel."
