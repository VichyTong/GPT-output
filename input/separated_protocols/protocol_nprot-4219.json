",
    "It was critical to determine the exact volume of media in order to properly convert compound units into concentrations \\(see Steps 9-11).  ",

    "When available, molecular weights of SEED compounds were taken from the SEED database.  ",
    "For SEED compounds without molecular weights listed, as well as for compounds falling into the \u201cOther\u201d category \\(i.e., defined but not listed in SEED), we curated molecular weights manually based on internet searches.  ",

    "With all of this information, we were able to calculate from, for example, the compound name \u201cCoCl2 x 6 H2O,\u201d the exact molar amounts of cobalt and chloride in a final medium composition, even if the original compound was listed in grams and not Moles.  ",
    "For the subset of compounds listed with units of volume rather than grams or Moles, we universally assumed that the densities of the fluids were equal to the density of water \\(1 gram per ml), in order to ease the conversion of units.  ",

    "**Step 11.",
