    "This method works very well for milligram quantities of cryptophane material.",
    "A solution of the cryptophane \\(~1 mM) is prepared using solvent S1 and placed in an open vial V1.",
    "A second solvent, S2 \\(precipitating solvent), is placed in a larger vial V2.",
    "S2 is chosen such that when mixed with S1 the cryptophane will become less soluble.",
    "The vial V1 containing S1 is then placed in vial V2, which is immediately sealed.",
    "Slow diffusion of S2 into V1 and S1 out of V1 will cause crystals to form.",
    "If S2 is more volatile than S1 the solvent level will increase inside V1 and prevent microcrystalline crusts from forming on the sides of V1.",
    "Most of the studied complexes were crystallized using the vapor diffusion method.",
    "**_Slow Evaporation_",
    "**",
    "This method works best for compounds that are insensitive to ambient conditions in the laboratory, as the vessel must be at least partially open to the surrounding environment to allow evaporation.",
    "A nearly saturated solution of the cryptophane \\(approximately 1 mM) is prepared in a suitable solvent.",
    "The solution is transferred to a clean crystal growing dish and covered loosely with a lid, such that solvent can slowly evaporate.",
    "The container should be placed in a quiet, out of the way place and left at rt for the solvent to evaporate.",
    "In the present study, only the cryptophane-CDCl<sub>3</sub> complex was crystallized by slow evaporation \\(of CDCl<sub>3</sub> solvent).",
    "**Crystal growth conditions:** ",
    "In all cases, a 1 mM cryptophane solution in the specified solvent was used. ",
    "Tripropargyl cryptophane CC- **1** \\(no guest):",
    "Tripropargyl cryptophane **1** was crystallized without guest in the crown-crown conformation.",
    "Crystals of **1** were grown from fluorobenzene using hexanes as precipitating solvent for vapor diffusion crystal growth.",
    "A small amount of electron density was observed within the cavity, suggesting that trace water or other solvent molecule may have gained access to the cavity.",
    "Crystallization of the completely empty cryptophane in crown-crown conformation may require rigorously dry solvents.",
    "Triallyl cryptophane CS- **2** \\(no guest):",
    "Triallyl cryptophane **2** was crystallized without any guests in the crown-saddle conformation.",
    "Single crystals of triallyl cryptophane **2** were obtained via dissolution in hot mesitylene, cooling to rt, and subjecting to vapor diffusion conditions with _n_ -pentane.",
    "Tripropargyl cryptophane **1**-xenon, triallyl cryptophane **2**-xenon, and cryptophane-A-xenon: The fluorobenzene solution of each cryptophane was bubbled with Xe gas.",
    "The precipitating solvent, \\(_n_ -pentane for tripropargyl cryptophane **1**, diethyl ether or _n_ -pentane for triallyl cryptophane **2**, and hexanes for cryptophane-A) was also bubbled with Xe and the headspace of the vapor diffusion vial \\(V2) was purged with Xe before it was sealed and left for crystallization.",
    "Triallyl cryptophane **2**-MeOH: Single crystals were obtained via vapor diffusion of diethyl ether into the methanolic cryptophane solution.",
    "Triallyl cryptophane **2**-CDCl<sub>3</sub>:",
    "Single crystals of the triallyl cryptophane **2**-CDCl<sub>3</sub> complex were grown in CDCl<sub>3</sub> by slow evaporation.",
    "Cryptophane-A-H2O: Single-crystal growth of cryptophane-A was attempted by vapor diffusion of hexanes into fluorobenzene solution.",
    "Most probably due to wet solvent, water molecules were trapped inside the cryptophane cavity, which gave the cryptophane-A-H2O complex.",

    "\\(e) Slow diffusion of the precipitating solvent from V2 \\(sealed with cover, shown in red) into V1 results in cryptophane crystal formation.",
    "**Note:**  ",
    "For efficient crystal growth, cryptophane solutions \\(~1 mM, 6 mL total) were prepared for multiple crystallization trials.",
    "Aliquots \\(2 mL) were put into three different vials, V1.",
    "Each V1 with the cryptophane solution was placed into separate V2 vessels containing hexanes, diethyl ether, or _n_ -pentane.",
    "For crystallization of cryptophane-A derivatives and their complexes, typically good crystals were obtained with only one of these three precipitating solvents, in an unpredictable fashion.",
    "**1** | Prepare 1 mM solution of cryptophane in chosen solvent \\(S1).",
    "In most cases hot solvent must be used to dissolve cryptophane.",
    "**2** | Put 2 mL of this solution \\(S1) into a 5 mL vial \\(V1, Fig. 2a).",
