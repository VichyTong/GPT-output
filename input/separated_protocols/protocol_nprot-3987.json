    "Note: Because they are sterile, opening and reconstitution of all recombinant proteins and other compounds should be performed under a hood using aseptic techniques. ",

    "Recombinant proteins are highly unstable.",
    "Repeated freezing-thawing cycles is not recommended as it will result in a rapid decreasing of their biological activity.",
    "Once thawed, aliquots can be kept at 4\u00b0C for a week.",
    "4. Differentiation protocol\r\n  ",
    "Note: This protocol is routinely used to differentiate different hESCs and IPSCs lines.",
    "However, some lines may require minor changes such as seeding density and GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor concentration.",
    "The example below describes the procedure to follow to differentiate cells in one T175 flask \\(Cat#3292, Corning).",
    "If performing differentiation in a smaller plate adjust media volume accordingly \\(for instance 3ml of N2B27 in a 12 well).",

    "Note: Other culture conditions \\(e.g.",
    "FCS containing medium, higher concentrations of PDGF-BB \\(100-300ng/ml), or fibronectin coating) are reported in the literature, but haven\u2019t been tested extensively for this protocol.",
    "As we aimed to generate VSMCs as close to their physiological counterpart as possible, proliferation inducing reagents such as FCS or PDGF-BB were omitted or kept at the lowest concentration possible.",
    "Therefore, under both conditions, VSMCs will not proliferate much, especially for the contractile condition.",
    "Completely pure populations of one subtype are difficult to achieve and with prolonged culture, the synthetic phenotype will become dominant. ",
    "In our hands this protocol always yields a pure population of VSMCs, however one could remove any potential CD144+ cells by MACS \\(see section 5 of the hPSC-ECs differentiation protocol)."
