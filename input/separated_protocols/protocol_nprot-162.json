    "**Transformation**",
    "**1** Inoculate 10 ml of YPAD medium with a single Y190 colony and incubate overnight at 30 &#x2DA;C. 55 ml of fresh YPAD are then cultured overnight to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3.",
    "Cells are then incubated by shaking at 200 RPM and 30 &#x2DA;C until they reach an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.7.",
    "**2** Harvest cells at 2000 RPM for 5 min at room temperature. ",
    "**3** Aspirate the media, wash cells in sterile water, and spin at 2000 RPM at 25 &#x2dA;C for 5 min. ",
    "**4** Aspirate water and resuspend cells in 1 ml of 0.1 M LiAc and transfer suspension to a fresh microfuge tube.",
    "Pellet cells at 6000 RPM for 15 s and aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Next, resuspend the pellet in 500 &#x3BC;l of 100 mM LiAc. ",
    "**5** Boil a 1 ml sample of ssDNA \\(2.0 mg/ml) and chill on ice.",

    "**7** Add the following gently over the cell pellet: 240 &#x3BC;l of PEG 3350 \\(50% w/v), 36 &#x3BC;l of 1.0 M LiAc, 25 &#x3BC;g of ssDNA \\(2.0 mg/ml), and 50 &#x3BC;l sterile water containing plasmid DNA for the interaction screen \\(0.1 &#x2013; 2.0 &#x3BC;g).",
    "Vortex mixture until cell pellet is completely mixed into suspension. ",
    "**8** Incubate the suspension at 30 &#x2DA;C for 30 min. Transform the yeast by heat shock at 42 &#x2DA;C for 15 min, mix suspension carefully and pellet cells at 6000 RPM for 15 s.",

    "**12** Yeast are then grown for 3 &#x2013; 5 days and scored for growth and color change."
