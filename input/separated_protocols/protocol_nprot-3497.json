    "Tamoxifen Preparation: Tamoxifen is administered at a standard dose of 0.25mg/g body weight.",

    "For most transgenic mice, between 3 and 5 doses of tamoxifen are appropriate.  ",
    "Recombination efficiency should be quantified in a known cell type expressing the gene driving the CreER.   ",

    "A chase period of at least 21 days is used to insure the absence of residual tamoxifen before injury\\(2), but this chase period is highly dependent on the gene driving CreER, tamoxifen dose, and injury model.  ",
    "Ultimately the chase period will have to be determined empirically by end user for their particular experimental design."
