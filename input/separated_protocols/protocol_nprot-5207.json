    "**Method** ",
    "In our present study we examined 270 blood samples from individuals: 120 healthy individuals, 65 suspected or pre-cancerous individuals and 85 cancer patients.",
    "The ages of individuals in patient group were from 35 to 72 years old and from 27 to 61 years old for the healthy control group.",
    "The blood samples from cancer or suspected or precancerous patients were collected from the colorectal, respiratory, breast and urology cancer clinics in St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Bradford.",
    "The patients were untreated or only treated with surgery at the related Department of Bradford Royal Infirmary \\(BRI), Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK.",
    "One hundred and twenty healthy volunteers were recruited within the School of Medical Sciences at the University of Bradford \\(West Yorkshire, UK).",
    "Ethical permission was obtained from both the BRI Local Ethics Committee \\(reference numbers 04/QI202/132 and 04/Q1202/15) and the University of Bradford\u2019s sub-committee of Research Ethics involving Human Subjects \\(reference number 0405/8).",
    "Selecting the patients was based on their random referral to a clinic at the onset of their suspected disease and the nature of their possible cancer was or was not confirmed.",
    "Each blood sample was divided into two identical volumes in different falcon tubes.",
    "The cells were exposed to UVA+B \\(PUVA lamp) with an intensity of ~ 1.20 mW/cm2 for 15 minutes and the results were compared to results without treatment in the comet assay.  ",
    "This protocol concentrated on simplicity and the speed of the preparation of slides.",
    "The whole blood samples are collected by using a vacutainer connected to a heparinised tube with a minimum of 2 mL blood The whole blood in heparinised tubes is potentially stable for a maximum of 72 hours in the dark at room temperature.",
    "The whole blood is transferred to a falcon tube and mixed with the same volume of RPMI and 10% DMSO \\( as an iron chelating agent) to prevent the oxidative effect of iron on the white blood cells).",
    "The mixture is aliquoted into 1.5mL Eppendorf\u00ae tubes then stored in -80\u00baC.",
    "To start the comet assay, the blood mixture is thawed by leaving the tube at the room temperature for 15 minutes.  ",
    "The blood samples should not be kept for longer than 15 minutes at room temperature \\(the temperature should be that to avoid producing   more DNA damage or starting   DNA repair in the lymphocytes).",
    "**Procedure**",
    "_Preparation_",
    "1.",
    "Slides \\(dust-free, frosted-end microscope slides) should be covered  with  1% normal melting point agarose at a  temperature around 100\u00baC and left t to dry at room temperature  overnight.\r\n  ",
    "2. Low melting point agarose \\(0.5%) should be ready to use at a temperature around 40 \u00baC.\r\n  ",
    "_Chemical treatment_",
    "1.",
    "To each 1.5mL Eppendorf\u00ae tube add 100\u00b5L of whole blood plus the treatment compound then top up with RPMI to the volume of 1mL. In order to create a better standardized assay it is required to have one tube without any treatment as a negative control and another one as a positive control with a compound which induces DNA damage in cells. \r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "After the incubation time, centrifuge the Eppendorf\u00ae tubes for 3 minutes at 900x g. Discard 960mL supernatant and keep 40 \u00b5L plus the pellet.",
    "Pipette 100 \u00b5L of 0.5% low melting agarose  and mix it with 40 \u00b5L of  the pellet and spread the 140 \u00b5L mixture on the prepared coated slide and protect it with a cover slip.",
    "Keep the slides on a cold surface for 2-3 minutes to allow solidification of the agarose, then transfer to the lysis solution. \r\n  ",
    "_Ultra violet treatment_",
    "Mix 40 \u00b5L of whole blood with 100 \u00b5L of 0.5% low melting point agarose and spread it on the slide and cover with a cover slip.",
    "The rest of procedure can be performed as above. ",
    "Keep the slides in lysis solution at a temperature of 4-8\u00baC for minimum of 2 hours before electrophoresis.",
    "Tip:",
    "To set the electrophoresis tank, use a voltmeter to create the right voltage \\(0.6 V/cm) inside the tank in case the voltage on the power system is inaccurate.",
    "The rest of procedure can be followed from the protocol of Olive and  Banath, 2006."
