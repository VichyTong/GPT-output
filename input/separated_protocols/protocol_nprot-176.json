    "In a given Q-PCR plate, there are typically at least two different primers used- one primer that will act as a loading control for cDNA levels \\(L32 or actin) and the experimental primer against the gene of choice \\(Dlgh1, galectin-1, etc.).  ",
    "Each primer will be run in a separate reaction.",
    "Each reaction should be run in either duplicate or triplicate.",
    "Thus, if you have 10 experimental conditions with 2 primers run in triplicate you will have 60 separate PCR reactions.  ",
    "Keep this in mind when calculating the amount of master mix and primers to add.",
    "You must run samples of known cDNA concentrations to calibrate the machine.",
    "This must be done each time you run a Q-PCR plate.  ",
    "This is done by making 3 or 4 -10 fold serial dilutions of one unmanipulated cDNA sample \\(Make these fresh each time).  ",
    "I usually will take 1 &#x3BC;L of a control sample cDNA and add 9 &#x3BC;L of DI water \\(10 fold dilution- volume 10 &#x3BC;L), then take 1 &#x3BC;L of the 10 fold dilution and add 9 &#x3BC;L of DI water \\(100 fold dilution-volume 10 &#x3BC;L), repeat this one more time to make a 1000 fold dilution.  ",
    "The primer I use for these reactions is L32, but one can use your experimental primer as well \\(Dlgh1, galectin etc).",
    "The primer you choose should amplify approximately within the same range as your experimental primer.  ",
    "While L32 is good for Dlgh1, 18s is not.",
    "I prefer L32 to calibrate the machine because it most often gives me a slope within the -3.2 or -3.4 range and there is enough of it in a given sample to be diluted 1000 fold and still be amplified.  ",
    "This calibration is essential to allowing you to quantify the relative amount of cDNA, this step instructs the machine as to what a 10 fold dilution looks like and it will compare your experimental samples to these control samples.  ",
    "When calculating the amount of master mix and primer to add to the L32 reaction \\(or actin or 18S control reaction of your choosing) remember to include calibration samples \\(usually four) in duplicate \\(add 8) or triplicate \\(add 12).   ",

    "3) Look at the melt curve for each primer.",
    "Each primer should only amplify one PCR product and should thus yield only one melt curve.",
