    "Based on the cultural and social practices, acceptability of disinfected PPE for reuse may vary in different settings.",
    "Considering these things in mind, it is a good idea to sensitize the potential users about benefits of reusability and allow them to decide whether they want to send the used PPE to trash or the recycle bin at the time of doffing.",
