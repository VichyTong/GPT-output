    "Cultivate cells endogenously expressing or stably overexpressing CXCR2 \\(i.e.",
    "HEK293-CXCR2 cells) \\(10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL) in a 24-well plate in DMEM medium plus 10% FCS overnight.\r\n  ",
    "2. Remove the medium and add binding buffer \\(medium without FCS).\r\n  ",
    "3. Put the plate on ice for 10 min.\r\n  4.",
    "Add cold agonist, i.e. rMIF or cold CXCL8 \\(0 &#x2013; 1 &#xB5;M) together with the tracer \\(40 pM of 125I -labeled recombinant CXCL8).\r\n  ",
    "5. Perform equilibrium receptor binding for 90 min at 4 &#xB0;C.\r\n  6.",
