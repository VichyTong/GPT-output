    "Optimal two-photon excitation of the three fluorochromes is achieved at 856 nm wavelength and spectral detection is at 510-540 nm \\(for CMFDA and FAM-FLIVO) and 560-600 nm \\(for SNARF1 and SR-FLIVO).",
    "Detector slits are configured to minimize crosstalk between channels.",

    "It is important to check for leakage between SR-FLIVO<sup>TM</sup> and CMFDA channels. \r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "The value of Maximum Amplitude of the SR-FLIVO, measured automatically by the LCS, provides an index of the incorporation of FLIVO and, consequently, information on the degree of apoptosis of the DC analysed \\(see below).",
    "To this value it should be subtracted the value of FLIVO channel background in the field where the cell is positioned \\(see **Supplementary Fig.",
    "5 online**, Ref 7). \r\n  ",
    "**G. Analysis of apoptotic DCs in the LN**",
    "1.",
    "A calibration for each batch of FLIVO<sup>TM</sup> is required to assess the value of the Maximum Amplitude of the FLIVO channel that marks the limit between non-apoptotic and apoptotic DCs.",
    "This limit value is determined in prior _in vitro_ experiments where the ability of FLIVO and Hoechst to stain apoptotic DCs is compared.",
    "In our experiments, non-apoptotic DCs, determined according to Hoechst staining, displayed a Maximum Amplitude of the SR-FLIVO channel equal or lower than 30 \\(see **Supplementary figures 4 and 5 online**, in Ref. 7).",
    "Thus, we considered the DCs that have a Maximum Amplitude of the SR-FLIVO above this value as apoptotic. \r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "This limit value may change with a different batch of FLIVO, hence, as indicated above, calibration is required every time the batch of FLIVO is changed.",
    "We obtained similar results either measuring the values of maximum intensities of SR-FLIVO or the ratio Maximum Amplitude SR-FLIVO over the Maximum Amplitude CMFDA, implying negligible leakage from the CMFDA channel.",
    "In case of doubt on the possibility of leakage, it is probably safer to represent the data as a ratio. \r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "In studies to ascertain whether a treatment increases or reduces the percentage of apoptotic DCs in the LNs, if the absolute value of the percentage of live DCs is not required, it is possible to analyse the results just by comparing the average value of the Maximum Amplitude of FLIVO in control and treated animals."
