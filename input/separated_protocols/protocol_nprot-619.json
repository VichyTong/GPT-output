    "A typical example of the hydrogelation with Clay-NS, ASAP, and _Gn_-binder is given below:",
    "1.",
    "Dissolve 3.0 mg of sodium polyacrylate \\(ASAP) in 1.0 mL of water.\r\n  ",
    "2. Dissolve 7.5 mg of _G3_-binder in 0.25 mL of water.\r\n  ",
    "3. Suspend 100 mg of Clay-NS to 3.75 mL of water.\r\n  ",
    "4. Stir the suspension of Clay-NS at room temperature such as 20 <sup>o</sup>C.\r\n  5.",
    "Add 1.0 mL of the aqueous solution of ASAP to the stirred suspension of Clay-NS at room temperature such as 20 <sup>o</sup>C.\r\n  6.",
    "Stir the ASAP-containing Clay-NS suspension for 10 minutes at room temperature such as 20 <sup>o</sup>C and confirm that it turns into a clear viscous solution.\r\n  ",
    "7.",
    "Dropwise add 0.25 mL of the aqueous solution of _G3_-binder to the vigorously stirred Clay-NS/ASAP solution.\r\n  ",
    "8.",
    "Let the resultant solution stand for 3 minutes and obtain a transparent, self-standing gel."
