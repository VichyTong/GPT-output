    "<p>*This protocol provides an example of testing 2 compounds for CYP3A inhibition, each in multiple concentrations ranging from 0.0030 \u00b5M to 10 \u00b5M. The first is ketoconazole (pan-CYP3A inhibitor) and the second is a compound of unknown CYP3A inhibition.",

    "Seal the assay and standard plates and centrifuge at 4,000 RPM for 20 minutes.</p><p>The plates must be sealed tightly before centrifuging to avoid evaporation.",

    "Continue with LC-MS/MS analysis immediately <strong>or</strong> freeze at -20\u00b0C until ready.</p><p>Note: In our experience freezing the diluted samples has no effect on results and provides a convenient way to conduct the experiment in batch and subsequently load plates onto the spectrometer as the instrument becomes available.</p><p><strong><u>Analysis of samples by LC-MS/MS:</u></strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaw plates (if applicable) and centrifuge briefly.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each unknown sample and calibration sample, <strong>inject 10 </strong>\u00b5L into a UPLC HSS C18 column (or other similar UPLC system).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare two solvents for gradient elution: 0.1% formic acid-water (Solvent A), and 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile (Solvent B).</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a Valco Valve to desalt the eluant to waste for the first 0.5 minutes.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform the chromatographic separation by gradient elution using a constant flow rate of 1 mL min<sup>-1</sup> for 2 minutes.",
