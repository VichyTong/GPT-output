    "**Protected substrates**",
    "1) Weigh out 200 mg of protected reducing carbohydrate into a 25 mL round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar.",
    "Fit the flask with a water condenser in the main neck and also a rubber septum in the second neck.",
    "Place a rubber septum into the top of the condenser.",
    "Flush the flask with argon and maintain under a positive pressure of argon by use of an argon balloon.",
    "Place the flask into an oil bath on the hotplate stirrer and fit a digital temperature probe to the hotplate stirrer.",
    "2) Transfer 5 mL of 1,4-dioxane into the flask using a disposable 5 mL syringe and a disposable needle.",
    "3) Weight out Lawesson&#x2019;s reagent \\(1.2 equivalents) in a glass vial and transfer to the reaction vessel by rapid removal of the rubber septum and subsequent replacement following addition.",
    "PRECAUTION Lawesson&#x2019;s reagent is toxic by inhalation and exudes a strong stench.",
    "It should be handled always inside a fume hood.",
    "4) Heat the reaction vessel to 80 &#xBA;C and stir at this temperature for 3-4 hours.",
    "\\(Completion of the reaction should be checked by t.l.c.)",
    "5) Cool the reaction to room temperature by lifting the vessel out of the oil bath.",
    "6) Filter the reaction mixture through a Celite&#xAE; pad into a round-bottomed flask and wash the Celite&#xAE; pad with 10 mL of 1,4-dioxane.",
    "Evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator.",
    "7) Purify the desired product by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with ethyl acetate:petroleum spirit to yield the desired glycosyl thiol.",
    "**Unprotected sugars for protein glycosylation**",
    "1) Weigh out 50 mg of unprotected reducing carbohydrate into a 10 mL round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar.",
    "Fit the flask with a water condenser in the main neck and also a rubber septum in the second neck.",
    "Place a rubber septum into the top of the condenser.",
    "Flush the flask with argon and maintain under a positive pressure of argon by use of an argon balloon.",
    "Place the flask into an oil bath on the hotplate stirrer and fit a digital temperature probe to the hotplate stirrer.",
    "2) Transfer 3 mL of 1,4-dioxane into the flask using a disposable 5 mL syringe and a disposable needle.",
    "3) Weight out Lawesson&#x2019;s reagent \\(1.2 equivalents) in a glass vial and transfer to the reaction vessel by rapid removal of the rubber septum and subsequent replacement following addition.",
    "PRECAUTION Lawesson&#x2019;s reagent is toxic by inhalation and exudes a strong stench.",
    "It should be handled always inside a fume hood.",
    "4) Heat the reaction vessel to 110 &#xBA;C and stir at this temperature for 48 hours. ",
    "5) Cool the reaction to room temperature by lifting the vessel out of the oil bath.",
    "6) Filter the reaction mixture through a Celite&#xAE; pad into a round-bottomed flask and wash the Celite&#xAE; pad with 10 mL of 1,4-dioxane.",
    "Evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator.",
    "7) Transfer 5 mL dichloromethane and 8 mL of water to the round-bottomed flask containing the resulting crude thiol and transfer the mixture into a separating funnel.",
    "Separate the layers and extract the organic layer with 4 portions of 8 mL of water.",
    "CRITICAL A few drops of methanol shall be added to the mixture to help separation.",
    "8) Freeze dry the aqueous layer.",
    "9) Use the crude glycosyl thiol in selenenylsulfide-mediated protein glycosylation stratergy."
