    "- Preparation of the Drosophila intestine for immunostaining on the visceral muscle",
    "1.",
    "Decapitate wild type flies \\(Use FITC/TRITC-conjugated phalloidin antibodies for staining visceral muscle fibers) or Mef2>mCD8GFP flies \\(which label visceral muscle fibers) in PBS using microscissors.\r\n  ",
    "2. Expose the forepart of the intestine by selective removal of legs, thoracic muscles and the thoracic junction cuticle to the abdomen using a pair of forceps.\r\n  ",
    "3. Make an incision from the beginning of the abdomen to the anus without damaging the intestine.\r\n  ",
    "4. Grab the anus and pull it carefully to separate the whole intestine from the abdominal cuticle.\r\n  ",
    "5. Remove the reproductive organ from the dissected intestine.\r\n  ",
    "6. Incubate the intestine in 4% PFA for 20 minutes.",
    "Nutation is optional for subsequent procedures except for the antibody incubation.",
    "Thorough nutation likely causes some damages of the intestine.\r\n  ",
    "7. Wash the tissue by 2 times in 0.1% PBST for 5 minutes.\r\n  ",
    "8. Permeabilize the intestine by incubation in 0.5% PBST for 10 minutes.\r\n  ",
    "9. Wash the tissue 3 times in 0.1% PBST for 5 minutes.",
    "If secondary antibody treatment is not required, simply proceed to adding Hoechst \\(1:400) and FITC/TRITC-conjugated phalloidin \\(1:200) in the tissue-containing solution and incubate for ~2 hours at room temperature \\(RT) on a nutator.",
    "Next, proceed to step 13.\r\n  ",
    "10.",
    "For secondary antibody treatment, incubate the tissue in 3% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% PBST for 30 minutes at RT for blocking.\r\n  ",
    "11.",
    "Add primary antibodies including anti-mouse tubulin antibody \\(Abcam, ab6046, 1:200) and anti-mouse myosin heavy chain antibody \\(DSHB, ALD-58, 1:100), and incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  ",
    "12.",
    "On the next day, wash the tissue by nutating in 0.1% PBST 3 times for 5 minutes, and the following antibodies were treated for 2 hours at RT in dark: anti-mouse dye-conjugated antibodies \\(1:200), FITC/TRITC-conjugated phalloidin antibodies \\(1:200) and Hoechst \\(1:400).\r\n  ",
    "13. Wash the tissue by nutating in 0.1% PBST 3 times for 5 minutes and in PBS 1 time for 5 minutes.\r\n  ",
    "14.",
    "Place the whole tissue on a slide glass and mount it in SlowFade solution \\(Invitrogen, CA, ID: S36936) with a cover glass.\r\n  ",
    "- Preparation of the Drosophila intestine for imaging of apoptotic responses on the visceral muscle",
    "1.",
    "Perform the same steps 1-6 described in the above tissue preparation section.\r\n  ",
    "2. Wash the tissue 2 times in 0.5% PBST for 10 minutes and discard the washing solution.\r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "Add 0.1 M sodium citrate in 0.1% PBST and incubate the tissue at 65\u00b0C for 30 minutes.\r\n  ",
    "4. Wash the tissue with PBS 2 times for 10 minutes.\r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "As a control group, add DNase solution \\(1.5 \u03bcl of DNase, 3 \u03bcl of 10 mg/ml BSA, 1.5 \u03bcl of 1 M Tris buffer with pH7.5, and 24 \u03bcl of H2O).\r\n  ",
    "6.",
    "For TUNEL reaction, incubate the experimental samples in 2 \u03bcl of TUNEL enzyme and 18 \u03bcl of buffer at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours.\r\n  ",
    "7. Wash the tissue in 0.1% PBST for 10 minutes and incubate with phalloidin-TRITC/FITC and Hoechst for 1 hour at RT.\r\n  ",
    "8.",
    "Wash the samples 3 times in 0.1% PBST for 10 minutes.\r\n  ",
    "9.",
    "Mount the sample for confocal imaging as described in the previous immunostaining section.\r\n  ",
    "- Confocal imaging of the visceral muscle and measuring the diameter of the intestine",
    "1.",
    "Obtain Z-stack images of the intestine using a confocal microscope \\(LSM710, Carl Zeiss).",
    "When taking the Z-stack images, pay attention to the visceral muscle layers which could be skipped easily for its shallow structure on the surface of the intestine.",
    "The characteristic multinuclei of the visceral muscle can be a hallmark to distinguish the muscle from the intestinal cells which also appear after the visceral muscle in the Z-stack images.\r\n  ",
    "2. Make a projection image using the Z-stack images and measure width of a few regions of the intestine as a representative diameter of the given intestine."
