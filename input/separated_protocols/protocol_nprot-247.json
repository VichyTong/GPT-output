[
    "1] Weigh out 1.4 g \\(10 mmol) of ethyl pyrrole-2-carboxylate into a 50 mL round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar.",
    "Fit the flask with a water condenser in the main neck and also a rubber septum in the second neck.",
    "Place a rubber septum into the of top of the condenser.",
    "Flush the flask with argon and maintain under a positive pressure of argon by use of an argon balloon.",
    "Place the flask into an oil bath on the hotplate stirrer and fit a digital temperature probe to the hotplate stirrer.",
    "2] Transfer 10 mL of distilled acetonitrile into the flask using a glass syringe and reusable 21 gauge needle.",
    "Turn the magnetic stirrer on. ",
    "3] Transfer 4.2 mL \\(30 mmol) of distilled triethylamine into the flask using a second glass syringe and reusable 21 gauge needle. ",
    "4] Weigh out 61 mg \\(0.5 mmol) of 4-di\\(methylamino)pyridine into a weighing boat and transfer to the reaction vessel by rapid removal of the rubber septum and subsequent replacement following addition.",
    "5] Weigh out 3.1 g \\(14 mmol) of di- _tert_-butyl dicarbonate into a weighing boat and transfer to the reaction vessel by rapid removal of the rubber septum and subsequent replacement following addition.",
    "6] Heat the reaction vessel to 50 &#xB0;C and stir at this temperature for 48 hours.",
    "7] Cool the reaction to room temperature by lifting the vessel out of the oil bath.",
    "8] Transfer the reaction mixture into a 100 mL separating funnel containing water \\(30 mL) and diethyl ether \\(30 mL).",
    "Separate the layers and extract the aqueous layer with two 30 mL portions of diethyl ether.",
