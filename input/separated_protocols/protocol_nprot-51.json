    "1)  Perform immunohistochemistry for chemokine receptors CXCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR4 on first trimester human placental paraffin-embedded sections as previously described \\[1], with microwave antigen retrieval using sodium citrate buffer \\(Zymed Laboratory Inc, San- Francisco, CA, USA). ",
    "2)  Stain with the same concentration of isotype match controls for each chemokine receptor on the same serial sections as controls.  ",
    "3)  Perform immunohistochemistry on decidual sections with NCR-Fc fusion proteins \\(prepared as previously described 3) by microwave heating the formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections in citrate buffer in order to retrieve antigens. ",
    "4)  Then stain sections with the different NCR-Fc fusion proteins or control-Fc \\(8 &#xB5;g/ml, final concentration) followed by biotinylated-goat-anti-human-Fc \\(Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). ",
    "5)  Detect using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method with a Vectastain kit \\(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)."
