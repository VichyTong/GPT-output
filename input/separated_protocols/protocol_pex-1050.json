    "<p><strong>Specimens Sampling</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A nasal mid-turbinate swab is collected by a supervised onsite self-collection or directly by a researcher, according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention Guideline for \u201cCollecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d.",
    "The nylon swab is immediately placed in a tube of 3.0 ml Universal Transport Medium System (UTM\u00ae) and vortexed in MixMate\u00ae at 400 rpm, within 3 hours, at room temperature.",
    "Then the swab is thrown out and the Viral Transport Medium is frozen at -80 \u00b0C until RNA extraction.",

    "Prior RNA extraction, an aliquot of 140.0 \u00b5L of the Viral Transport Medium is inactivated in lysis buffer (AVL, 560.0 \u00b5l) and in each sample, 5.0 \u00b5L of MS2 Phage RNA (Internal Positive Control IPC, to monitor extraction, reverse transcription and PCR amplification - included in TaqPath\u2122 Covid-19 kit) and 5.6 \u00b5L carrier RNA-AVE (to&nbsp;increase the yield of extracted RNA - included in QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit) are added.",
    "The purified RNA is eluted in 50.0 \u00b5L and immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><strong>SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA a Multiplex Real Time RT-PCR reaction (TaqPath\u2122 Covid-19 RT-PCR kit) is used.",

    "In addition, a bacteriophage MS2 IPC (with reporter dye JUN) is also amplified to verify the efficacy of the sample preparation and the absence of inhibitors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction mix added to each Viral RNA sample (5.0 \u00b5L) is the following: 5.0 \u00b5L of TaqPath\u2122 1-Step Multiplex Master Mix (No ROX\u2122) (4X), 1.0 \u00b5L of TaqPath\u2122COVID-19 Assay Multiplex and 9.0 \u00b5L molecular-grade, nuclease-free water (total volume reaction = 20.0 \u00b5L).",
    "In each run, a standard curve is added to check the efficiency of the amplification; the 2019-nCoV DNA Control (1 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> copies/\u00b5L) is diluted serially with Control Dilution Buffer (both included in TaqPath\u2122 COVID-19 kit) 1/4 fold per dilution; five microliters of each standard point are then distributed in the wells with 15.0 \u00b5L of reaction mix, to produce five concentrations of copies/reaction (c/r): 6250.00 c/r (ST1), 1562.50 c/r (ST2), 390.62 c/r (ST3), 97.66 c/r (ST4) and 24.41 c/r (ST5).",
    "Also 5.0 \u00b5L of molecular-grade, nuclease-free water (NTC, No Template Control) is run, to monitor non-specific amplification, cross-contamination and nucleic acid contamination of reagents.",
