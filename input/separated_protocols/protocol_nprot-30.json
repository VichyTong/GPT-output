    "1|",
    "The substrates for BM can be prepared by mixing and annealing of two simple DNA intermediates \\(forked, tailed and ssDNAs) \\(Fig.",
    "2).",
    "2|",
    "When constructing the substrates with four arms \\(X-junctions, PX-junctions), it is important that one of the arms is non-homologous relative to three others \\(Fig.",
    "2a, b shaded), otherwise it would be impossible to prepare forked DNA intermediates.",
    "3| To block spontaneous BM<sup>6, 7</sup> at least a single base pair heterology has to be introduced into duplexes involved in BM \\(Fig.",
    "1b).",
    "The substrates for 3-stranded BM reaction should have at least four bases of heterology, because shorter regions of heterology are not sufficient to block spontaneous 3-stranded BM, which proceeds more efficiently than spontaneous BM on 4-stranded DNA substrates<sup>6, 7</sup>.",
    "When constructing PX-junctions or replication forks a heterologous base should be placed at least several bases away from the junction.",
    "**Preparation of substrates for BM**",
    "1|",
    "Purify the individual oligonucleotides by electrophoresis in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel.",
    "Label one of the oligonucleotides using \\[&#x3B3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, followed by DNA purification through the Micro-BioSpin 6 column \\(Bio-Rad).",
    "Determine concentrations of all oligonucleotides spectrophotometrically using known molar extinction coefficients \\(can be obtained from the IDT website www.idtdna.com).",
    "2| To prepare tailed or forked DNA intermediates \\(Fig.",
    "2), mix equal amounts of each of the complementary ssDNA strands \\(usually 1 &#xB5;M of molecules) in 1 x SSC buffer, heat for 3 min at 95&#xB0;C, and allow annealing to proceed for 1 hour at optimal hybridization temperature \\(T<sub>h</sub>).",
    "Calculate Th using the formula: T<sub>h</sub>=1.24 x T<sub>m</sub>-43.8; where T<sub>m</sub> is a melting temperature of the double-stranded part of the resulting structure.",
    "Calculate the T<sub>m</sub> using a tool from the Promega website \\(www.promega.com/biomath/calc11.htm).",
    "**Testing of BM activity of proteins**",
    "1| Test BM activity in a range of protein concentrations by adding increasing amounts of your protein to the annealed BM structure \\(e.g.",
    "BM activity of Rad54 protein can be detected in 5-1000 nM range) and incubating the mixture for the desirable time at the reaction temperature.",
    "2|",
    "Measure the time course of the BM reaction at the appropriate protein concentrations.",
    "**Separation of BM products in polyacrylamide gel**",
    "1| Stop the reaction by addition of SDS \\(to 1.5%), place on ice, mix with a 1/10 volume of loading buffer \\(70% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and analyze by electrophoresis in native 5-10% polyacrylamide gels in 1 x TBE.",
    "Run the gel at 11 V/cm for 1.5-2 hours.",
    "Some proteins form very stable complexes with DNA whose disruption requires treatment with SDS \\(1.5%) and proteinase K \\(800 &#xB5;g/ml) for 1-15 min at room temperature before electrophoresis.",
    "Alternatively stop the reaction by addition of 1/10 of the reaction volume of polydT \\(1 mg/ml, GE Healthcare) followed by 1 min incubation at 23&#xB0;C and by deproteinization with SDS and proteinase K, as described above.",
    "Concentration and acrylamide/bis-acrylamide ratio of polyacrylamide gels may vary depending on the size and structure of BM substrates.",
    "Some structures \\(e.g.",
    "X-junctions) become unstable during electrophoresis at room temperature and should be resolved at 4&#xB0;C.",
    "2|",
    "Dry the gel on DE81 chromatography paper, visualize and quantify the products of BM using a PhosphorImager system \\(GE Healthcare), or any other appropriate device."
