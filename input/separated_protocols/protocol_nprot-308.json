    "1.  Harvest HeLa S3 cells from a culture of approximately 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in a 2-L spinner flask by centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 &#xB0;C.\r\n  2.   ",
    "Wash the cell pellet by gentle resuspension in ice-cold PBS and repeat the centrifugation as above.\r\n  ",
    "3.  Wash the cell pellet again with ice-cold nucleus-isolation buffer and resuspend the cell pellet by gentle agitation in 50 mL of ice-cold nucleus-isolation buffer supplemented with 0.5% \\(v/v) Triton X-100.  ",
    "Allow the cells to swell for 10 min on ice.\r\n  ",
    "4.   Homogenize the swollen cells on ice with 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer on ice.  ",
    "Pour the suspension of homogenized cells \\(about 60 mL) into two 50-mL conical tubes and centrifuge them at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 &#xB0;C.\r\n  5.   ",
    "Pour off cloudy supernatants slowly and then gently resuspend each nuclear pellet in approximately 5 mL of nucleus-isolation buffer plus Triton X-100.  ",
    "Add nucleus-isolation buffer to bring the suspension to the original volume \\(approximately 30 mL per tube) and pellet the nuclei again by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 &#xB0;C.\r\n  6.   ",
    "Repeat step 5, at least twice, until the nuclei are pure white and the supernatant is clear.\r\n  ",
    "7.   Resuspend each nuclear pellet gently in approximately 5 mL of nucleus-isolation buffer and combine the suspensions in one conical tube.  ",
    "Adjust the total volume to approximately 20 mL with nucleus-isolation buffer.  ",
    "Remove a 5-&#x3BC;L aliquot and measure the absorbance at 260 nm in 1 mL of a saturated solution of NaCl and urea, using this solution as a blank, to quantify the amount of chromatin DNA \\(20 OD<sub>260nm</sub> = 1 mg/mL DNA).  ",
    "The total yield should be close to 30 mg of chromatin as DNA.  ",
    "Pellet the nuclei by centrifugation at 10,000 x g and carefully remove the supernatant.  ",
    "Freeze the nuclear pellet in liquid nitrogen and store at &#xFF0D;80 &#xB0; C."
