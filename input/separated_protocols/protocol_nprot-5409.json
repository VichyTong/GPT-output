    "1 FLIP/FLIP-FlpE targeting vector design and construction",
    "Our cloning strategy is based on SapI restriction enzyme-mediated Golden Gate assembly and involves 3 steps.",
    "First, an intron insertion site \\(MAGR \\(A/CAG/Pu)) as well as an overlapping \\(or nearby)",
    "CRISPR/Cas9 target sequence is identified in order to design PCR primers to amplify a 300 \u2013 1,000 bp genomic region up-",
    "and downstream of the intron insertion site.",
    "Second, gene-specific homologous arms are amplified using the previously designed PCR primers, which also contain SapI sites.",
    "Finally, the purified homologous arms are used in Golden Gate assembly to insert them into the plasmid backbone containing the FLIP or FLIP-FlpE intronic cassette to generate the final targeting vector. ",
    "1.1 Designing homologous arms for a FLIP/FLIP-FlpE targeting vector",
    "1.1.1 There are several criteria which must be met in order to identify an appropriate FLIP or FLIP-FlpE cassette insertion site \\(Figure 1): 1) To ensure gene inactivation after Cre recombination, the cassette insertion site \\(intron insertion site \\(MAGR \\(A/CAG/Pu)))",
    "needs ideally to be within the first 50% of the coding region.",
    "2) Insertion of the intronic cassette must leave both parts of the split exon to be over 60 bp long.",
    "3) The intron insertion site must have an overlapping \\(or at least nearby) CRISPR/Cas9 target sequence, which can be on either of the two DNA strands.",
    "Note that target sequences with a PAM sequence \\(NGG) present in the intron insertion site cannot be used unless silent mutations are generated, as the PAM sequence will not be destroyed after the intron insertion.",
    "When the intron insertion site does not overlap with the CRISPR/Cas9 target sequence, the introduction of several silent mutations that prevent Cas9 binding needs to be considered. ",
    "1.1.2 For both mouse and human genes, all putative intron insertion sites as well as overlapping \\(or nearby)",
    "CRISPR/Cas9 sites are identified in Supplementary Table 2 of the associated publication. ",
    "1.1.3",
    "Once both the intron insertion site and the corresponding CRISPR/Cas9 target site have been identified, the genomic sequence up-",
    "and downstream of the intron insertion site can be obtained from the UCSC genome browser \\(https://genome.ucsc.edu).",
    "The upstream region will be used for the left homologous arm \\(LHA) and the downstream region will be for the right homologous arm \\(RHA).",
    "The size of each homologous arm can vary from 300 to 1,000 bp and it is desirable to choose a region devoid of SapI restriction enzyme sites, since this enzyme will be utilised in the Golden Gate assembly \\(Figure 2). ",
    "1.1.4 To ensure successful intron splicing, it is key to insert the FLIP/FLIP-FlpE intronic cassette precisely between the third and the last sequence of the intron insertion site \\(MAGR \\(A/CAG/Pu)), i.e. between \u2018MAG \\(A/CAG)\u2019 and \u2018R \\(Pu, A/G)\u2019. ",
    "1.1.5",
    "When designing primers for the LHA, the forward primer \\(LHA-L) can start 300 \u2013 1,000 bp upstream of the intron insertion site.",
    "For the reverse primer of the LHA \\(LHA-R), the first 3bp \\(A/CAG) of the intron insertion site must be the last 3bp. ",
    "1.1.6 When designing primers for the RHA, the forward primer \\(RHA-L) must start from the last sequence \\(Pu, A/G) of the intron insertion site and the reverse primer \\(RHA-R) may start anywhere from 300 \u2013 1,000 bp downstream of the intron insertion site. ",
    "1.1.7 Again, caution should be taken to ensure that the regions used for the homologous arms do not contain any SapI site, as this enzyme will be used during Golden Gate assembly. ",
    "1.1.8 For optimal primer design, we recommend using Primer3Plus \\(primer3plus.com/cgi-bin/dev/primer3plus.cgi) with the following adjustments: 28 bp optimal primer length, 65\u00b0C optimal melting temperature \\(Tm), and a 300 - 1000 bp product size range. ",
    "1.1.9 The 28bp sequences are then linked to invariable overhangs containing a SapI site, resulting in the final primer sequences that will be used for amplification of both homologous arms \\(Table 1).",
    "As a result, the four primers for the amplification of both homologous arms will be: LHA-L \\(GTTTAAACGCTCTTCTGTGN\\(24-36)), LHA-R \\(GTTTAAACGCTCTTCTTACCTG/TN\\(21-33)), RHA-L \\(GTTTAAACGCTCTTCTTAGA/GN\\(23-35)) and RHA-R \\(GTTTAAACGCTCTTCTTTA N\\(24-36)).  ",
    "1.2 FLIP/FLIP-FlpE targeting vector assembly",
    "1.2.1 PCR amplification of the homologous arms: use a high fidelity polymerase \\(e.g., Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase \\(#M0530S, New England Biolabs)) and set up two PCR reactions for the LHA and RHA \\(Table 2) using genomic DNA from mESCs as a template. ",
