    "Clone your protein of interest in the pGADT7-RecAB vector, and two or more interactor proteins into the pGBKT7 vector using standard procedures in E. coli and proceed to yeast transformation.",
    "1. Inoculate 10 ml of YPAD medium with a single fresh AH109 colony and incubate overnight on a shaker at 30\u02daC. Dilute the overnight culture with fresh to OD600  of 0.15 and incubate with shaking for approximately 2 h until OD600 is around 0.7.\r\n  ",
