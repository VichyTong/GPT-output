    "1) For uptake measurements, grow yeast cells to logarithmic phase in YNB medium supplemented with 3% glucose and 1 mM L-arginine. ",
    "2)  Harvest cells at OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 to 0.8, wash, and resuspend in 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 8. ",
    "3)  ",
    "Five minutes before the uptake measurement, supplement cells  with 6% glucose and incubate at 30&#xBA;C. ",
    "4)  To start the reaction, add 450 &#xB5;L of cell suspension to 400 &#xB5;L of the same buffer containing 200 &#xB5;M methylammonium and 10 nM <sup>14</sup>C-methylammonium \\(2.11 Gbq/mmol; Amersham).",
    "5)  After 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 min, withdraw 200 &#xB5;L aliquots, dilute in 5 mL ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer containing 200 mM methylammonium, and filter through glass fiber filters \\(GF/C; Whatman).",
    "6)  Wash filters twice with 5 mL of cold deionized water and analyze by liquid scintillation spectrometry."
