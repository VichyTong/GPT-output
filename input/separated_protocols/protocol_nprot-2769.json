    "Culture at 28 \u00b0C with shaking \\(250 r.p.m) for 18 h.",
    "CRITICAL STEP Shaking, temperature and duration \\(at least 36 h) are important for good bacterial growth.",
    "The temperature can\u2019t be higher than 30\u00b0C because Agrobacterium lose its plasmid in high temperature.",
    "14| Measure the OD at 650 nm using a spectrophotometer. ",
    "CRITICAL STEP",
    "The OD of large scale culture must higher than 1.0, to get enough Agrobacterium for vacuum infiltration.",
    "15| Spin the Agrobacterium culture down \\(4,300\u20135,500g is fine) for 10 min at 4\u00baC. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in liquid medium containing 30 g<sup>-1</sup> sugar.",

    "F) Agrobacterium infection and vacuum infiltration",
    "16| Fix the pots and soil with preservative film to avoid the soil to be scattered. ",
    "17| Remove the opened flowers and open up the floral buds with forceps.",
    "CRITICAL STEP",
    "The floral buds with final size or near final size generated more transformants than developing buds.",
    "Please do not open up small buds. ",
    "18| Add Silwet L-77 into Agrobacterium medium and adjust its concentration to 0.005%.",
