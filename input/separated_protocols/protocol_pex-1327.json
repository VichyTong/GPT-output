    "<p><strong>Experiment design considerations</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>SIESTA<strong> </strong>experiments are based on parallel monitoring of protein stability changes in cell lysate aliquots treated with vehicle, enzyme, its co-substrate, or a combination of the enzyme with co-substrate.",
