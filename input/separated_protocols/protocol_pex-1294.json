    "This protocol was created and refined for cell pellets equal or larger than 100 \u00b5L; for the rest of this protocol, we will refer to those appropriate quantities.",
    "To the frozen cell pellet, add appropriate volume of ice cold CER I solution and vortex at highest setting for 15 seconds or until the pellet is fully suspended.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incubate on ice for 10 minutes.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add appropriate volume of the kit\u2019s ice cold CER II solution to the suspended cell pellet and once again vortex at the highest setting for 5 seconds.",

    "Mix gently on a cyclical rotator (15 rpm) at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pool the lysate and bead mixture into a pre-chilled one 1 mL gravity flow column with a capped bottom outlet, and remove the bottom cap.",
