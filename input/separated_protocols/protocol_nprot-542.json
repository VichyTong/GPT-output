    "Thaw the frozen vial of PMEF at 37 &#xB0;C water bath for 1 minute and spin down at approximately 160 x g \\(~ 1000 r. p. m. using cell culture centrifuges) for 5 minutes.\r\n  ",
    "2. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in DMEM with 10% FBS medium. \r\n  ",
    "3. Plate the PMEF suspension onto gelatin-coated plated at a density of 50,000-100,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>.\r\n  ",
    "4.",
    "Discard hESC medium from dish \\(60mm dish) and add dispase \\(2-3 ml).\r\n  ",
    "Caution Usually hESCs take 6-7 days for further passage and subculture, but this can vary depending on plating density and the specific hESC line used. ",
    "5. Incubate at 37 &#xB0;C for 2&#x2013;3 min and check under the microscope.",
    "When the edges of hESC colony starting to detach \\(&#x201C;rolling up&#x201D;), harvest the hESC colonies in fresh hESC medium.",
    "Under these conditions most hESC colonies should detach while PMEFs should remain attached.\r\n  ",
    "6. Centrifuge the harvested hESCs for 5 min at 160 x g at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant. \r\n  ",
    "7. Repeat step 6.\r\n  ",
    "Critical step Repeated washing is necessary to dilute out dispase as no inactivation of enzyme is performed.",
    "Incomplete washing out of dispase prevents hESC colonies from attachment and leads high levels of cell death. ",
    "8.",
    "Pipette and triturate the hESC pellet with 1 ml of hESC medium using P1000 micropippet.\r\n  ",
    "Critical step The number of repeats and the intensity of pipetting determine size of hESC colonies.",
    "Colonies that remain too large tend to spontaneously differentiate while hESCs triturated too harshly tend to die upon replating. ",
    "9.",
    "For subculture, plate hESCs onto fresh PMEF plates at a ratio from 1:5 to 1:8.",
    "Incubate at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 37 &#xB0;C.\r\n  Critical step It is important to assure that hESC colonies are dispersed evenly within the plate by carefully shaking dishes. ",
    "10.",
    "For differentiation \\(Day 0), plate small fraction of hESCs \\(approximately 5 x 10<sup>3</sup> &#x2013; 30 x 10<sup>3</sup> cells / 60 mm dish) onto mitotically inactivated MS-5 plate \\(60 mm dish, approximately 1.2 million MS5 cells/dish).\r\n  ",
    "Critical step The number of hESC cells in a MS-5 dish \\(60 mm dish) corresponds to ~2% of the undifferentiated hESCs harvested from a 60 mm dish prior to passage. ",
    "11.",
    "From Day 3 to Day 7, change KSR medium supplemented with Noggin \\(500 ng/ml) every 2-3 days. \r\n  ",
    "12.",
    "At Day 7 and Day 12, change KSR medium supplemented with Noggin \\(500 ng/ml), Shh \\(200 ng/ml SHH), and FGF8 \\(100 ng/ml). \r\n  ",

    "From Day 12 to Day 24, change N2 medium supplemented with AA \\(0.2 mM), Shh \\(200 ng/ml SHH), FGF8 \\(100 ng/ml) and BDNF \\(20 ng/ml) every 2-3 days. \r\n  ",
    "Caution The combination of cytokines/growth factors added at late P0 stage \\(after Day 12) and P1 stage \\(Step 15) can be fine-tuned to increase neural crest yield.",
    "The number of NC \\(p75+) cells is significantly increased upon exposure to bFGF or BMP4.",
    "Agonists of these pathways can reduce neural crest induction efficiency<sup>18</sup>.",
    "In addition to impacting NCC induction, different combinations of extrinsic factors also affect lineage specification.",
    "As observed in various model systems in the mouse and chick embryo, manipulations of the Wnt, BMP, FGF, retinoic acid \\(RA) and Shh pathways can greatly impact lineage decisions during neural crest development<sup>19</sup>.",
    "Concentrations of each extrinsic factor need to be individually optimized for applications aimed at biasing lineage choice.",
    "Typical concentrations for manipulating neural crest yield are: Wnt \\(Wnt3A or Wnt1A 40 ng/ml), BMP4 \\(50 ng/ml), FGF8 \\(100 ng/ml), RA \\(0.5 &#x3BC;M), Shh \\(200 ng/ml), SU5402 \\(10 nM), Dkk1 \\(100 ng/ml) and Noggin \\(500ng/ml).",
    "14.",
    "Approximately at day 20 of differentiation numerous neural rosette structures should emerge from the differentiating hESCs \\(Figure 1). \r\n  ",
    "15.",
    "At day 28 of differentiation, rosettes structures were harvested mechanically using 1 ml syringe attached fine needle \\(termed passage 0; P0) and gently re-plated on 15 &#x3BC;g/ml polyornithine/1 &#x3BC;g/ml laminin \\(PO/Lam)-coated culture dishes in N2 medium supplemented with AA \\(0.2 mM), Shh \\(200 ng/ml), FGF8 \\(100 ng/ml) and BDNF \\(20 ng/ml) \\(termed passage 1; P1).",
    "Change medium every 2-3 days.\r\n  ",

    "Next day, wash three times the PO-coated dish with PBS and coat 1 &#x3BC;g/ml Lam in PBS for more than 2 hours.",
    "Just before plating rosette structure, dry PO/Lam-coated dish.",
    "16.",
    "At the Day 6 or 7 in P1 culture, change medium with Accutase for 20~30 minutes and harvest the P1 culture with cell scraper. \r\n  ",
    "Caution To determine NC population in culture, P1 culture can be screened by immunocytochemistry.",
    "Neuroectodermal marker \\(Pax6) positive and NC marker \\(AP2) positive can be used to determine the proper neural differentiation and the existence of NCCs in P1 culture \\(Figure 1). ",
    "Caution If you need to prepare a NCC-depleted population, you can manually pick up the rosette structures and remove any surrounding cells using a fine needle \\(27-30G) attached 1ml syringe. ",
    "17.",
    "Centrifuge the harvested P1 culture for 5 min at 160 x g at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Cells are mechanically triturated in PBS containing 2% serum. \r\n  ",
    "18.",

    "Caution It is essential to have controls of hESC-derived NCCs that are unstained and stained with appropriate secondary antibodies only for defining sorting gates in the FACS machine.",
    "Most cells under these conditions either double positive \\(p75+ and HNK1+) or double negative.",
    "Therefore, it is possible use sorting for single markers \\(HNK1 or p75) without a major loss of specificity.",
    "However, using single markers outside the narrow differentiation window \\(P1 stage) may result in contamination with CNS neuroblasts or other type of cells.",
    "Dead cells can be excluded for cell sorting using 7-AAD.",
    "21.",
    "Double positive cells are collected in PBS containing 2% serum. \r\n  ",

    "These hESC-NCCs are culture with N2 medium supplemented with 20ng/ml of FGF2 and 20ng/ml of EGF changed every 2-3 days and passaged every 7-8 days. \r\n  ",
    "Critical step Minimum plating number is 50,000 ~ 100,000 cells per square centimeter for survival of sorted cells.",
    "To ensure good viability of sorted cells, minimize pipetting and other mechanical stress. ",
    "Caution For preparing PO/Lam/FN-coated plate, coat 15 &#x3BC;g/ml PO in PBS in 60 mm dish for overnight.",
