    "Keep it at room temperature.\r\n  ",
    "The use of DNAse reduces the amount of DNA fibers which favour aggregation and clumping of cells lowering the culture yield. ",
    "Hyaluronidase is often used in conjunction with collagenase to dissociate the extracellular matrix between cells in animal tissues.",
    "2. Treat the coverslips with 0.1 mg/ml of poly-D-lysine during one hour and then rise thoroughly.",

    "4.",
    "The adrenal glands must be immediately extracted after the sacrifice of the animal and placed on ice cold HBSS supplemented with antibiotics.",
    "A medial laparothomy is the preferred surgical approach to get adequate access to both adrenal glands.\r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "Under a dissection stereomicroscope, eliminate the adipose tissue surrounding the gland with a stainless steel scalpel blade and proceed to decapsulate the adrenal glands; then, remove the adrenal cortex to isolate the medullar tissue \\(see Additional material).\r\n  ",
    "Try to be careful when you handle the gland, don&#xB4;t crush it.",
    "Keep the tissue always wet with cold HBSS as a means to preserve it and to remove the fatty tissue more easily.",

    "Drop 3 ml of the dissociation solution in the lid of a small culture dish. \r\n  ",
    "8. Put the medullas into the dissociation solution and cut each of them in four pieces with the help of a scalpel blade or two insulin needles.",
    "Recover the medulla chunks and the solution and transfer them to a Falcon tube using a glass Pasteur pipette with a fire polished broad tip \\(around 2-3 mm diam.).\r\n  ",
    "9. Place the tube in a thermostatic bath at 37&#xBA;C and start counting the time for the enzymatic digestion \\(25-30 min). \r\n  ",
    "10.",
    "The solution must be gently resuspended every 10 min with a Pasteur pipette with a fire polished broken tip.",
    "Over the last 5 min the solution is continuously resuspended until the medullary tissue becomes not visible by eye; then, you must stop to avoid damage of the cells.\r\n  ",
    "11.",
    "To stop the enzymatic reaction, add cold HBSS until a final volume of 10 ml.\r\n  ",

    "Stain the cells with trypan blue solution \\(0.2%) and count the cells in a hemocytometer chamber to estimate both the yield and the cellular viability.",
    "An alternative viability test is the flow cytometric analysis of fluorescent signal in cells labeled with the vital dye fluorescein diacetate \\(FDA, 0.12 uM).\r\n  ",
    "Also the purity in CC of our cultures can be estimated by staining the cells with neutral red, a dye that selectively reacts with monoamine-containing cells.",
    "18.",
    "The functional viability of the cells can be evaluated by different assays.",
    "Just a few examples: autofluorescence measurements, fluorimetric cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements \\(basal levels or increments evoked by high K<sup>+</sup> containing solutions or acetylcholine \\[ACh] signals) or electrophysiological recordings of ACh-activated currents."
