    "See Fig. 1 for an overview of the procedure.",
    "**1.",
    "Preparation of bacteria**",
    "Replicate RNAi library bacterial glycerol stocks onto LB plus Ampicillin plates and grow overnight at 37&#xB0;C.  ",
    "The day before setting up a screen, inoculate bacteria into 400 &#xB5;l to 800 &#xB5;l \\(depending upon the final volume required; 40 &#xB5;l of bacteria are required for each individual feeding experiment) of 2&#xD7;TY plus 100 &#xB5;g/ml ampicillin and grow overnight in a shaking incubator at 37&#xB0;C.",
    "**2. Induction of bacteria**",
    "The following morning, induce transcription of dsRNA by adding IPTG to each well of the bacterial cultures to a final concentration of 4 mM and incubate at 37&#xB0;C for 1 hour.  ",
    "Pellet bacteria by spinning at 3,500 rpm for 5 minutes.  ",
    "Discard supernatant and re-suspend in an equal volume of single peptone plus 100 &#xB5;g/ml ampicllin plus 4 mM IPTG.",
    "**3.",
    "Preparation of worms**",
    "For worm strains with a brood size similar to wild-type worms, approximately 10 L1 worms are added to each well of a 96-well plate.  ",
    "For worm strains with a reduced brood size, more worms should be used per well such that the total brood per well is similar to that of wild-type worms &#x2013; this allows easy comparison between wells and the robust identification of genetic interactions.  ",
    "L1 stage worms are easily prepared by filtering mixed stage or starved populations of worms through a 10 &#xB5;m mesh: wash worms off plates in M9 buffer and isolate L1s by centrifugation through a 10 &#xB5;m mesh for 10 seconds at 1,000 rpm.  ",
    "Alternatively, L1s can be prepared by bleaching gravid adults on the previous day and hatching worms overnight in M9 buffer.  ",
    "L1 worms should be re-suspended at a concentration of approximately 10 L1 worms per 10 &#xB5;l of M9 buffer.",
    "**4.",
    "RNAi feeding**",
    "Pipette approximately 10 L1 worms in a volume of 10 &#xB5;l of M9 buffer into each well of a 96-well plate from a plastic tray using a multichannel pipette.  ",
    "To avoid settling of worms, the plastic tray should be agitated whilst pipetting.  ",
    "For genetic interaction screens it is best to directly compare the RNAi phenotypes observed in a mutant strain with that seen in wild-type \\(N2) worms.  ",
    "This can be achieved by alternating rows of wild-type and mutant worms in a 96-well plate, each row fed with the same bacterial clones \\(see Fig. 1).",
    "For combinatorial RNAi, add an equal volume of each bacterial feeding clone to each well \\(20 &#xB5;l of each strain, grown overnight and induced independently).  ",
    "For effective combinatorial RNAi, an RNAi hypersensitive strain, such as __rrf-3\\(pk1426)__ should be used \\[6].",
    "**5.",
    "Incubation**",
    "Worms are grown in a shaking incubator for 4 days at 20&#xB0;C.  ",
    "To avoid evaporation of liquid from wells, 96-well plates should be stacked in plastic containers within the incubator.  ",
    "For temperature sensitive strains it may be necessary to use a lower or higher temperature and longer incubation time.",
    "**6.",
    "Scoring of phenotypes**",
    "Plates are scored on a dissecting microscope 4 days after setup \\(see Fig. 2 for example phenotypes).  ",
    "We score embryonic lethality \\(Emb phenotype) and sterility \\(Ste) semi-quantitatively on a scale from 0 \\(wild-type) to 3 \\(100% Emb or Ste).  ",
    "To identify genetic interactions, an RNAi phenotype observed in a mutant worm strain is directly compared to both the RNAi phenotype observed in wild-type worms and to the phenotype of the mutant strain fed on a control bacterial strain.  ",
    "Suitable control strains are those expressing a dsRNA that does not target any expressed sequence in __C. elegans__.",
    "**7.",
    "Replication**",
    "RNAi has an intrinsic variability.  ",
    "Therefore it is essential to replicate any putative phenotypes and genetic interactions observed.",
    "**TIMELINE**",
    "day &#x2013;4 \\(approx): chunk worms to ensure you have enough L1 worms on day 0.",
    "day &#x2013;2 \\(or earlier): replicate bacterial glycerol stocks onto plates, grow overnight.",
    "day &#x2013;1: grow bacteria overnight \\(optional: bleach worm strains and hatch overnight in M9).",
    "day 0: induce bacteria, filter worms, add L1 worms and bacteria to 96-well plates, incubate in shaker.",
    "day 4: score plates.",
    "day 5: re-score plates."
