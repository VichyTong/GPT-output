    "**Preparation and characterization of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells**",
    "Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells \\(BMDCs) were expanded from hematopoietic progenitors isolated from C57BL/6 mice.<sup>13</sup>",
    "After red cell lysis with ACK buffer, progenitors were cultured in RPMI-1640 plus L-glutamine, 10% FBS, 50 nM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% penicillin/streptomycin.",
    "Fresh medium with 15 ng/ml of GM-CSF and 10 ng/ml of IL-4 were added to cultures on day 0, 3, and 5.",
    "BMDCs were harvested on day 7 and analyzed by flow cytometry for CD11c expression \\(70-80% of the expanded cell population, **Figure 2**). ",
    "**Preparation of mature or tolerogenic DCs**",
    "BMDCs were harvested on day 7 and pre-treated with the absence or presence of CDDO-DFPA \\(400 nM) for 4 hours before LPS \\(100 n\uf06dg/ml) treatment for 24 hours.",
    "BMDCs were then treated with MOG \\(35-55) \\(100 \u03bcg/ml) for 4 hours prior to the administration.",
    "**Induction and evaluation of EAE**",
    "EAE was induced in 8-10 week old female C57BL/6 mice.",
    "Methods for passive induction of EAE by ex vivo expanded BMDCs were adopted from previously described protocol.<sup>14</sup>",
    "In brief, mice received 2\u00d710<sup>6</sup> LPS-stimulated, MOG-pulsed CD11c+ BMDCs at a total volume of 200\u2009\u03bc\uf06dL injected subcutaneously \\(100\u03bc\u2009\uf06dL into each hind leg).",
    "On the day of BMDC transfer and 48 hours later, each mouse also received 200 ng of pertussis toxin \\(PTX), and DCs were injected into C57BL/6 mice once each week for four consecutive weeks.",
    "Mice were monitored daily for survival and symptoms of EAE, using standard criteria \\(**Video 1**).<sup>12</sup>"
