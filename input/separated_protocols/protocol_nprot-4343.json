    "It is very important not to use previously frozen or otherwise manipulated samples, as this will result in loss of interactors.  ",
    "It is also strongly advised to test the specificity and suitability of antibodies for immunoprecipitation with Western blotting first, and verify the specificity of the antibody for the bait by including appropriate controls such as identical tissues or cells not expressing the bait \\(for example using a gene knockout model).  ",
    "While mass spectrometry is exquisitely sensitive, it cannot correct for insufficient antibody specificity or affinity or for suboptimal performance of the immunoprecipitation.  ",
    "Thus the bait should be highly enriched as compared to input and the antibody should be highly specific for best results.  ",
