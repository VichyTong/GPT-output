    "EGFP and DsRed coexpressions are to differentially visualize the two groups of cells. \r\n  ",

    "After 48 hrs, wash L cells twice with PBS, followed by trypsin treatment of the cells.\r\n  ",

    "After trypsin treatment, add 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum to inactivate trypsin. \r\n  ",
