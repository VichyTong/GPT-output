    "6. Remove the lymph nodes from AR10 and transfer into DPBS to wash by brief rinsing.\r\n  ",
    "7.",
    "In another clean petri dish, add 1 mL of fresh AR10 and place a 70 \u00b5M cell strainer in the middle of the dish.\r\n  ",
    "8. Pick up the lymph nodes with a pair of forceps and transfer into the middle of the cell strainer.\r\n  ",
    "9. Use the plunger end of a syringe to gently grind the lymph nodes against the cell strainer for about 5 minutes.\r\n  ",
    "10.",
    "The culture medium will turn cloudy as the lymph nodes disintegrate, leaving a small amount of white connective tissue in the strainer.\r\n  ",
    "**CRITICAL STEP**: While grinding the lymph nodes, change the angle and direction often to ensure complete breakdown of the tissues to recover the maximum amount of LNCs.",
    "11.",
    "Pipette 1 mL of fresh AR10 and rinse the bottom of the cell strainer to wash the extra LNCs into the petri dish.",
    "There should be 2 mL of LNC suspension at this step.\r\n  ",

    "Each single well should now have 2 million LNCs and each is expected to expand 8-10 fold after 6 days.\r\n  ",
