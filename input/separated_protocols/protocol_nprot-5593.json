    "Single cell preparation**:",
    "1) Isolate single cells \\(multiple single cell isolation methods are available, for example, the CellRaft system, which was used here) and deposit into 0.2-ml PCR tubes containing 2.5 \u00b5l PBS.",
    "2) Immediately place the tubes on dry ice and store at -80\u00b0C.",
    "**2.",
    "Whole genome amplification**:",
    "Carry out the following Step 1) to 4) in a PCR workstation.",
    "1) Add 1 \u00b5l exo-resistant random primers and 3 \u00b5l lysis buffer containing 400 mM KOH, 100 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA solution, into the PCR tube containing a single cell.",
    "2) Flick the mixture several times, spin down quickly and keep it on ice for 10 min.",
    "3) Add 3 \u00b5l stop buffer containing 400 mM HCl and 600 mM Tris-HCl solution \\(1 M, pH7.5) to neutralize the lysis buffer.",
    "Keep it on ice for 2 min. ",
    "4) Add 32 \u00b5l of master mix containing 30 \u00b5l MDA reaction buffer and 2 \u00b5l Phi29 polymerase.",
    "Mix by pipetting gently.",
    "5) Incubate at 30\u00b0C for 1.5 hr and 65\u00b0C for 3 min.",
    "**3.",
    "Amplified product purification**:",
    "1) Purify amplified product with 75.6 \u00b5l AMPureXP-beads and mix it by pipetting.",
    "2) Leave the mixture at room temperature for 5 min and put it on a magnetic separator until the solution is clear. ",
    "3)",
    "Remove the clear liquid by pipetting and wash beads twice with fresh 80% ethanol. ",
    "4) Open lid of the tube to air-dry beads for about 5 min. \\(Avoid beads cracking)",
    "5) Take out the tube from magnetic separator and elute beads using 32 \u00b5l nuclease-free water. ",
    "6) Put back the tube to magnetic separator and keep it at room temperature for 5 min until the solution is clear and a pellet is formed again.",
    "7) Transfer 30 \u00b5l clear liquid from the tube to a clean tube.",
    "8) Store the purified product at 4\u00b0C for short-term storage or -20\u00b0C for long-term storage.",
    "**4. Concentration and size measurement**:",
    "1) Dilute the purified product 10-20 times and quantify the samples using Qubit.",
    "Usually, the yield of the purified product is 10-12 \u00b5g. ",
    "2) Check the product size by agarose gel electrophoresis.",
    "The following conditions are recommended: 1.0% agarose gel; 1.0% TBE solution; 100V for 40 min.",
    "A bright band \\(with a little smear) over 10 kb in a gel picture is desirable. ",
    "**5.",
    "Estimation of amplification uniformity**: ",
    "1) Dilute the purified product and unamplified genomic DNA as a control to 1 ng/\u00b5l using nuclease-free water.",
    "2) Prepare 96-well plate and the PCR mixture for each well including 5 \u00b5l Fast Sybr green master mix, 1 \u00b5l locus-specific primers, 2 \u00b5l nuclease-free water and 2 \u00b5l diluted DNA.",
    "3) Seal the plate and spin down.",
    "4) Incubate under the following qPCR program: 95\u00b0C for 20s, thermocycling \\(40 cycles) at 95\u00b0C for 3 s, and 60\u00b0C for 30 s.",
    "5) Calculate the relative uniformity values \\(RUVs) for 8 loci \\(equation \\(1) in Supplementary Notes, Dong et al., Nature Methods in press).",
    "6) Select the samples with RUV values for at least 6 of the 8 loci of between 0.25-4 for library construction."
