    "Embryos from the hybrid strain \\(C57/B6xDBA/2)F1 overcome the 2-cell block and develop into blastocysts in _in vitro_ culture.",
    "This strain consistently produces at least 10-20 robust embryos per female.",
    "Mice should be 25-30 days old when superovulated to generate the most malleable embryos for injection.",

    "Uninjected embryos serve as environmental condition negative controls for the MO-injected embryos.",
    "In addition, embryos injected with Human Globin MO \\(HG-MO) serve as negative controls to demonstrate that developmental hindrance is not an artifact of microinjection.",
    "In each experiment, uninjected embryos and embryos injected with HG-MO were tested in parallel with Oct4-MO-mediated knockdown.  ",
    "HG-MO was designed to specifically target a mutant human globin gene promoter, which would not be present in the mouse genome \\(Gene-Tools, Inc.).  ",
    "We had tested this HG-MO when establishing our methods and found that its presence did not affect blastocyst developmental rates.",
    "Of note, genes that were previously validated to be differentially-expressed between uninjected and Oct4-MO-injected embryos were also confirmed to show no differential expression between uninjected and HG-MO-injected embryos 21. ",
    "Injection station.",
    "Use of a Hoffman microscope with phase-contrast objectives and 40x magnification facilitates both the visual differentiation between an embryo and an oocyte, and the identification of pronuclei so they can be avoided during delivery of the MO into the cytoplasm.",
    "An anti-vibration platform \\(Visitek) placed directly under the microscope minimizes the possibility of trauma caused by a large puncture wound from a trembling needle.",
    "Tears from an unsteady needle can cause major damage to the embryo and may be the reason for the developmental arrest in some samples.",
    "Two micromanipulators attached to the microscope, one for holding and the other for injecting the embryo, move the glass pipettes in 3 different planes and are driven electrically and manually.",
    "Electrical control ensures fast coarse movement \\(bringing the needle/holding pipette into the microinjection drop), while the manual manipulator is used for the finer movements necessary to move and microinject embryos.",
    "Negative suction is controlled on the holding side by an Eppendorf Oil Tram, which creates negative/positive suction on the holding pipette.",
    "These glass holding pipettes were created with a pipette puller \\(Sutter Instrument P97) according to optimized conditions \\(**Table 1**) and finished on a microforge \\(De Fonbrune).",
    "The injection pipettes were also created on the Sutter&#x2019;s P97 with program for injection pipettes/needle \\(**Table 1**).",

    "Orient the holding and microinjection pipettes on the left and right sides so that they are opposite one another in the field of view.",
    "10 Turn on the microinjector air pressure.",
    "Once the injection needle is completely prepared, set the air pressure to 0.5-1.3 PSI so the MO is continuously flowing through the needle at a rate that will not lyse the embryo once it has been injected.",
    "11 Transfer 40 embryos from the petri dish of M2 with a pipette into the microinjection droplet on the microscope stage.  ",
    "Reserve at least 15 of these embryos for the uninjected control group and sequester them from the batch of embryos meant for injection \\(**Figure 2**).",
