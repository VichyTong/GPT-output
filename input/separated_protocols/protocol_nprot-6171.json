    "It is important to provide features running in different directions in the training set, otherwise the neural net may only pick up features in one direction based on the Fourier patten.",
    "Also, you may want to check the stage of the microscope, since this may suggest the sample is not tilted exactly around the x axis. ",
    "\u2022 It is also vital to cover various states of the target feature.",
