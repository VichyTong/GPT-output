    "2.",
    "Add  glass beads \\(Sigma) equal amount to that of pellet to facilitate cell lysis by vortexing for 15 cycles \\(1 min of vortexing and 1 min of resting on ice), followed by centrifugation at 13,400 \u00d7 g for 30 min. \r\n  3.",
    "Subject the supernatants to TAP as described by Rao et al. in 2013  with some modifications. \r\n  ",

    "In the first round of purification, incubate cell lysates with 50 ul of anti-FLAG M2 agarose \\(Sigma) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C.\r\n  5. Perform a second round of purification with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid \\(NTA) agarose \\(Qiagen) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. \r\n  ",
    "6. Wash the beads once for 5 min in 300 mM ammonium acetate and once for 5 min in 150 mM ammonium acetate. \r\n  ",
