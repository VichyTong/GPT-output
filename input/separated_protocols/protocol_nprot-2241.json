    "EQUIPMENT SETUP",
    "Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of the NMT-OO system in our study.",
    "The software, imFLUX \\(YoungeUSA), controls several basic components of this system by adjusting the power supply, imaging with a digital camera, and managing the main component: the optrodes. ",
    "   ",
    "The following describes the construction of the measuring system: A LED power supplier controls the voltage signal to a blue LED \\(503\u2013505 nm).",
    "A 20\u00d7 microscope \\(Newport, USA) objective focuses light from the LED onto the optical fiber, which is coupled to a blue filter leading the excitation light to the MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor \\(World Precision Instruments, USA).",
    "Fluorescence emission is conducted by the fibers and split by the fiber coupler again.",
    "When the red fluorescence signal reaches the PMT \\(Hamamatsu, Japan), the signals are transformed into electrical signals and conducted into a Lock-in-Amplifier \\(SRS 530).",
    "Then, the phase shift and fluorescence intensities are recorded by the computer and analyzed by imFLUX \\(YoungerUSA\uff0cUSA). ",
    "PROCEDURE",
    "Experimental measurements",
    "1.",
    "Calibration of the optrode: We calibrated the optrode in the calibration medium with two different concentrations of oxygen \\(0 and 21% oxygen).",
    "The phase angles of the fluorescence signals of these two concentrations were measured and a linear slope was calculated. ?",
    "TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n  2. Equilibration of plant material: The 4-day-old seedlings were dipped into the measuring buffer \\(\u00bd MS liquid medium) for 30 minutes before measuring.\r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "Immobilizing the plant material: The measurement of oxygen flux with the optrode occurs in an aqueous environment; therefore, we needed to immobilize the sample to avoiding unwanted stirring, and movement.",
    "The method used to immobilize the sample must be gentle enough to prevent mechanical damage to the tissues and allow free access of the optrode to measure the tissue.",
    "As shown in Figure 3a, we used two small pieces of filter paper to clamp the root of Arabidopsis, leaving about 2\u20133 mm of the root tip free for microsensor measurement. ?",
    "TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n  4.",
    "Adjusting the measuring position of the optrode by a stepper motor: Caution\\!",
    "The tip of the optrode sensor is fragile.",
    "Move the optrode gently to avoid breaking the tip. \r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "At each measuring point, the optrode is vibrating between two positions at a distance of 30 \u03bcm \\(Figure 3a).",
    "We set an optimal vibration frequency to avoid stirring and to obtain stable results with 2 seconds of quiet time before measuring and 1.92 seconds of measurement at each position in our experiments.",
    "Thus, time of measurement at each position is 8.6 seconds at each measuring point. ?",
    "TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n  6.",
    "Start the measurement with a reference measure by placing the optrode in a background place, i.e., in the medium as far away from the sample as possible \\(Figure 3b).",
    "When the base level of oxygen flux in the environment is steady at a baseline, move the tip of the optrode to a position near \\(5 \u03bcm) the periphery of the sample root \\(Figure 3b).",
    "Measurement of oxygen flux in the background position and the rhizophere of Arabidopsis are shown in Figure 3c.\r\n  ",
    "7.",
    "Based on the aim of the experiment, we can adjust control probe positioning and angle of oscillation.",
    "As shown in Figure 4a, we mapped the oxygen flux rate on the periphery of the root apical region in Arabidopsis.",
    "We also analyzed the effect of hydrogen peroxide \\(H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) on the oxygen flux rate as shown in Figure 4b."
