    "<p><em>1.0 Objective of the Review</em></p><p><br></p><p>",
    "We frame the review using standards for formulating research questions and searches in systematic reviews, using a PICoST approach: population/problem (P), interest (I), context (Co), and Time (T) and Scope (S) (Table 1).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The activity of interest (I) is adaptation-related responses.",
    "Due to the lack of scientifically-robust literature assessing the potential effectiveness of responses, we use the term \u2018adaptation-related responses\u2019 rather than the more common \u2018adaptations\u2019 to avoid the implication that all responses (or adaptations) are actually adaptive (i.e. reduce vulnerability and/or risk); some responses labelled as \u2018adaptations\u2019 might in fact be maladaptive.",
    "To be included, responses must be initiated by humans.",
    "This includes human-assisted responses within natural systems, as well as responses taken by governments, the private sector, civil society, communities, households, and individuals, whether intentional/planned or unintentional/autonomous.",
    "While unintentional/autonomous responses are included, these are likely to be under-represented unless labelled as adaptation and documented as a response to climate change due to the infeasibility of capturing potential adaptive activities not identified as adaptations.",
    "We exclude responses in natural systems that are not human-assisted; these are sometimes referred to as evolutionary adaptations or autonomous natural systems adaptations.",
    "While important, autonomous adaptation in natural systems is distinct from adaptations initiated by humans; this review focuses on responses by humans to observed or projected climate change risk.",
    "We include any human responses to climate change impacts that are, or could, decrease vulnerability or exposure to climate-related hazards, as well as anticipatory measures in response to expected impacts.&nbsp;</p><p>This review focuses on adaptation only, and excludes mitigation (responses involving the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations).",
    "We consider adaptation responses across contexts (Co) globally, and focus only on adaptation activities that are directly intended to reduce risk, exposure, or vulnerability, even if later identified as maladaptation.",
    "To reflect publications since AR5 and prior to the AR6 publication cut-off, we focus on literature published in the time period (T) between 2013 and 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>",
    "This review focuses on the scientific literature only, and excludes grey literature and other sources of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (IKLK).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>2.0 Summary of search strategy</em></p><p>This protocol represents Part 1 of a 5-part series outlining the phases of this initiative.",
    "Part 1 provides an introduction to the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) and an overview of methods.",
    "Related protocols are outlined in Table 2.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>",
    "A summary of the steps and protocols included in the GAMI work is shown in Figure 1.",
    "A flowchart of the number of GAMI articles and phases of inclusion and exclusion is provided in Figure 2.</p>"
