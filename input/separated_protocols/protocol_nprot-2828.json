    "Ba-doped Ta<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub> nanorods are fabricated following the steps depicted in the flow diagram in Fig.",
    "1.",
    "The detailed procedure is as follows:",
    "1. _",
    "Preparation of Ta substrate.",
    "_",
    "Ta sheet is cut into desired size \\(e.g., 1 \u00d7 5 cm<sup>2</sup>).",
    "The Ta substrate is then cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol by sonication, each for 10 min.",
    "Finally, it is dried thoroughly with a N<sub>2</sub> gun before loading into the evaporation chamber.\r\n  ",
    "2. _Deposition of aluminum layer._",
    "Aluminum slug with a weight of <sub>0.5 g is loaded on a tungsten evaporation boat.",
    "Ta substrate is put 30 cm above the aluminum source.",
    "The evaporation chamber is pumped to a base pressure of </sub>3 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup>",
    "Pa with a diffusion pump.",
    "Aluminum layer is evaporated on the Ta substrate at a rate of 10-30 nm/s. The deposition rate and thickness are measured with a quartz crystal thickness monitor.",
    "The thickness of the Al layer deposited on the Ta substrate is about 2-3  \u03bcm. \r\n  ",
    "3. _Growth of PAA mask._",
    "The Al-coated Ta is anodized in 0.3 M oxalic acid solution at 40 V to form a PAA mask.",
    "The electrolyte is cooled with a water bath to a temperature of ~5 \u00b0C and under stirring with a magnetic stirrer.",
    "The Al layer is anodized thoroughly until the pores reach the Ta substrate.",
    "This can be judged from the anodizing current, which decreases to nearly 0 when the anodization of Al is completed.",
    "The variation of the diameter of the nanorods can be achieved in this step.",
    "PAA masks with different pore sizes can be fabricated by varying the anodizing voltage.",
    "Correspondingly, the composition and concentration of the electrolyte should be changed to achieve a stable anodization. \r\n  ",
    "4. _Widening the pores of the PAA mask._",
    "The pore size of the PAA mask is about 30 nm.",
    "To widen the pore size of the PAA mask, the sample is dipped into a 5% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution for 90 s. The temperature of the solution is heated to 60 \u00b0C with a water bath.",
    "After etching, the sample is rinsed with pure water.",
    "The diameter of the nanorods can also be varied in a certain range by changing the etching time. \r\n  ",
    "5. _",
    "Through-mask anodization.",
    "_",
    "The Ta substrate coated with PAA mask is then anodized in 0.5 M H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> solution at room temperature under stirring.",
    "The anodizing voltage is ramped from 0-650 V at a rate of 0.1 V/s and kept at 650 V for 1 h. Caution should be taken with the high voltage used here.",
    "The length of the nanorods can be varied by either the anodizing voltage or anodizing time.\r\n  ",
    "6. _Selective etching of the PAA mask.",
    "_",
    "After the growth tantalum oxide nanorods by through-mask anodization, the PAA mask is selectively etching with a 5% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution.",
    "The sample immersed in the H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution is put into a natural convection oven held at 60 \u00b0C for about 4 h. After that, the sample is thoroughly rinsed with pure water and dried with a N<sub>2</sub> gun.\r\n  ",
    "7. _",
    "Loading of Ba precursor.",
    "_",
    "Ba precursor is loaded on the surface of the tantalum oxide nanorods by dipping the sample into a 0.1 M Ba\\(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution for about 10 s and then dried with a N<sub>2</sub> gun. \r\n  ",
    "8. _Nitridation.",
    "_",
    "The tantalum oxide nanorods loaded with Ba precursor are then nitrided in a horizontal tube furnace.",
    "The sample is loaded into an alumina boat and placed in the center of the heating zone.",
    "The tube is sealed with air-tight flanges.",
    "Before heating, the tube is purged with N<sub>2</sub> to get rid of air.",
    "The furnace is then heated at a rate of 20 \u00b0C/min to 1000 \u00b0C under NH<sub>3</sub> flow \\(5 sccm).",
    "The temperature is kept at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h and then cooled naturally to room temperature.",
    "After that, the tube is purged with N<sub>2</sub> again to get rid of NH<sub>3</sub> before taking out the sample.",
    "Caution should be taken with the hazardous NH<sub>3</sub>.",
    "The furnace is put into a fume hood in case that there is any leak of NH<sub>3</sub>.",
    "The gas outlet of the tube furnace is connected to a NH<sub>3</sub> trap consisting HCl solution."
