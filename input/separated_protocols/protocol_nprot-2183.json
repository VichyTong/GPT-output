    "**A. Preparation of immobilized antibodies for the primary ChIP**",
    "**General points to note:**",
    " As disuccinimidyl suberate \\(DSS) crosslinking is quantitative and because crosslinking will randomly occur in the epitope recognition domain of some molecules, the overall titer of functional antibodies will be decreased.  ",
    "We generally start with 5-times more antibodies than used for a regular ChIP.",
    "Thus for a ChIP assay regularly performed with 3\u00b5g antibody per 25\u00b5l protein A beads, the reChIP assay is performed as following \\(for 10 primary IPs):",
    "Timing: ~1-2 days",
    "1. \\(Optional):",
    "When the antibody is stored in presence of primary amine buffers like glycin or Tris, take 150\u00b5g of antibody and dialyse overnight against 1xPBS. \r\n  ",
    "2. Quantify the amount of antibody recovered from the dialysis step \\(Bradford assay).\r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "Wash 250\u00b5l \\(500\u00b5l slurry) protein A sepharose beads \\(SIGMA P9424)",
    "twice with 500\u00b5l sodium borate washing solution \\(50mM Na-borate, pH 8.2).\r\n  ",
    "4. Dilute the antibody 1/1 with Sodium Borate washing solution; then add it into the prewashed protein A beads.",
    "Incubate during 1hour at room temperature.",
    "In the meantime, adapt DSS crosslinker to room temperature before opening \\(avoid condensation of water).\r\n  ",
    "5. Centrifuge the protein A/antibody mix \\(425xg); recover the supernatant and quantify the amount of antibody that was not crosslinked.",
    "**CRITICAL STEP:**",
    "Yields close to 80% of crosslinked antibody should be obtained after 1hour incubation; if it is not the case, increase the incubation time.\r\n  ",
    "6. Wash the crosslinked beads with sodium borate washing solution.\r\n  ",
    "7. Resuspend 1.625mg DSS \\(162.5\u00b5g/25\u00b5l beads) in 250\u00b5l dimethylsulfoxide \\(DMSO) or dimethylformamide \\(DMF).",
    "Add 250\u00b5l PBS and immediately add into the preloaded protein-A beads.",
    "Incubate at room temperature during 1 hour \\(rotating table).",
    "**CRITICAL STEP:**  Prepare the DSS solution just before adding it into the preloaded beads.\r\n  8.",
    "Wash the crosslinked beads twice with 1xPBS.",
    "Add 1ml ethanolamine \\(0.1M) to inactivate remaining DSS.",
    "Incubate 10 min at room temperature.\r\n  ",
    "9.",
    "To remove non-crosslinked antibodies, add 1ml of glycine \\(0.1M, pH 2.8), vortex briefly, and recover supernatant in 25\u00b5l Tris-base \\(1M, pH 8.8) in order to neutralize the acidic conditions.",
    "Quantify the amount of antibody in the supernatant to estimate crosslinking efficiency.",
    "**CRITICAL STEP:**",
    "Up to 10% of the loaded antibody amounts may be retrieved.\r\n  ",
    "10.",
    "Wash crosslinked beads twice with sodium borate washing solution and resuspend in 500\u00b5l PBS.",
    "The crosslinked affinity resin can be stored for weeks at 4\u00b0C. \r\n  ",
    "**B. ReChIP assay.",
    "**",
    "**General points to note:**",
    "The following sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation \\(reChIP) steps correspond to modifications to be included to the standard ChIP procedure previously described by Mendoza et al<sup>14</sup> which is an adaptation of previous standard procedures.",
    "Time: 3 days",
    "   ",
    "1.",
    "Albeit depending on the antibody, the yield of IPed DNA in a reChIP is generally extremely low; we pool at least four primary ChIPs \\(2 million cells each) done with DSS crosslinked antibodies \\(4-times 15\u00b5g antibody crosslinked to 25\u00b5l protein A beads).\r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "Elution for the first immunoprecipitation \\(IP) is done with 10 mM DTT \\(60\u00b5l per 25\u00b5l resin, 30\u00b0C for 30 minutes); 4 eluates are combined for the secondary IP.\r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "To avoid DTT effects on the second IP, the combined eluates are diluted at least 30-times with the ChIP lysis buffer of choice.\r\n  ",
    "4. Use smallest possible volume \\(30\u00b5l elution buffer) for reChIP elution.\r\n  ",
    "**C. ReChIP validation and LinDA amplification prior massive parallel sequencing**",
    "**General points to note:** ",
    "Due to the low yields of a reChIP assay, its validation prior LinDA amplification and further high-throughput sequencing is performed by qPCR in a reduced number of target sites which were previously characterized.",
    "The immunoprecipitated material is then amplified following a linear procedure previously described by Shankaranarayanan et al<sup>13</sup> and the massive parallel sequencing is performed following standard procedures \\(e.g.",
    "ChIP-seq DNA sample preparation kit, Illumina).",
    " ",
    "1.",
    "From a typical reChIP eluate performed in 30\u00b5l; keep 14\u00b5l for LinDA amplification and take the remaining 16\u00b5l for qPCR validations.\r\n  ",
    "2. Perform qPCR validations with at least 2 technical replicates per evaluated region:",
    "2\u00b5l DNA per target region; 1\u00b5l 10uM primers mix; 5ul of Quantitect SyBr master mix \\(total volume: 10\u00b5l per reaction).",
    "**CRITICAL STEP:**  ",
    "Under these conditions, 4 target sites can be validated without dilution; nevertheless reChIP eluate can be diluted 2 to 5-times to increase the number of sites that can be validated.",
    "Note however that this may affect the accuracy of the quantification and is therefore not recommended.\r\n  ",
    "3. Take 14\u00b5l of the reChIP material for linear DNA amplification as following the corresponding protocol<sup>13</sup>.\r\n  4.",
    "Evaluate the amplified material by qPCR as indicated in step 2.\r\n  5.",
    "Perform library preparation for massive parallel sequencing by following standard conditions."
