    "Lentiviral production:",
    "Lentiviruses were produced in HEK 293T cells by co-transfecting pMD2.G, pRSV-Rev and pMDLg/pRRE helper vectors together with the vector for one transcription factor using 2.5 M CaCl2.",
    "75 \u03bcg of transcription factor plasmids was used together with 30 \u03bcg of PMDLg/pRRE, 22 \u03bcg of pMD2.G and 15 \u03bcg of pRSV-Rev plasmids for two T175 flasks.",
    "Medium was changed 16 hours after transfection and viruses were harvested 48 hours after transfection, pelleted by centrifugation \\(20,000 x g for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C) resuspended in 100 \u03bcl DMEM, aliquoted and kept at -80\u00b0C. ",
    "iAs generation:",
    "Day -2",
    "Dissociate hESC or hiPSC with Accutase and replate 5x105 cells in Matrigel-coated 6-well plates with mTeSR1 containing 10 \u03bcM Rock inhibitor.",
    "Day -1",
    "Aspire medium and add 2 ml of fresh mTeSR1 containing 8 \u03bcg/ml of Polybrene per well.",
    "Add 1 \u03bcl of each virus per well.",
    "Day 0",
    "Aspire medium and add 2 ml of fresh mTeSR1 containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline per well.",
    "Days 1 and 2",
    "Aspire medium and add 2 ml of Expansion Medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline, 1.25 \u03bcg/ml of Puromycin and 200 \u03bcg/ml of Hygromycin per well.",
    "Day 3",
    "Aspire medium and add 2 ml of 3:4 of Expansion Medium and 1:4 of FGF Medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline and 200 \u03bcg/ml of Hygromycin per well.",
    "Day 4",
    "Aspire medium and add 2 ml of 1:1 of Expansion Medium and FGF Medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline and 200 \u03bcg/ml of Hygromycin per well.",
    "Day 5",
    "Aspire medium and add 2 ml of 1:4 of Expansion Medium and 3:4 of FGF Medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline and 200 \u03bcg/ml of Hygromycin per well.",
    "Day 6",
    "Aspire medium and add 2 ml of FGF Medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline.",
    "Day 7",
    "Dissociate cells with Accutase and pellet at 300g for 5 min. Replate cells in Matrigel-coated coverslips, petri dishes or wells according to desired output.",
    "Use the necessary amount of FGF Medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline.",
    "Day 8",
    "Aspire medium and add fresh FGF Medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline.",
    "Day 10",
    "Aspire half of the medium and add the same amount of Maturation Medium containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline.",
    "From here, change half of the medium every 2-3 days."
