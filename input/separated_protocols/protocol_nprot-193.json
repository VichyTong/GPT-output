    "**ii** Add 200 &#xB5;l of chloroform per ml of Trizol used to the homogenate.",
    "Shake tubes vigorously by hand for 15 seconds.",
    "**iii** Centrifuge refrigerated at 4000 rpm for 15 min. Transfer aqueous phase \\(upper phase) to 2 ml eppendorf tubes.",

    "without polytron homogenization).",
    "**2** Precipitate total RNA by adding 1 volume of isopropanol.",
    "For maximum recovery of total RNA we usually precipitate overnight at -20 &#xB0;C.",
    "After centrifugation \\(13000 rpm for 20 min at 4 &#xB0;C) the pellet is washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in RNase free water at a final concentration of 2.5 &#xB5;g &#xB5;l<sup>-1</sup>.",

    "The choice of protein A or protein G beads depends on the isotype of the antibody used.",
    "In our experiments we have successfully used protein-A Sepharose beads to precipitate polyclonal antibodies produced in rabbits.",
    "100 &#xB5;l of protein-A Sepharose bead slurry \\(50% w/v) per sample will yield a pelleted bead volume of approximately 50 &#xB5;l.",
    "CRITICAL STEP Avoid centrifugations at high speed as this may damage the beads.",
    "Centrifugations between the washes should be performed at 4000 rpm for 20 seconds.",
    "**4** Remove excess of IPP150 buffer from the pelleted beads.",
    "Then add the antibody in fresh IPP150 buffer to yield a total volume of 150 &#xB5;l and mix gently.",

    "**Refolding of RNA** TIMING Day 2, 5 min",
    "**5**",
    "The binding of RBPs to target sequences may require appropriate RNA folding.",
    "We therefore denature the total RNA preparation \\(20 &#xB5;l of 2.5 &#xB5;g &#xB5;l<sup>-1</sup>; 50 &#xB5;g;) at 95 &#xB0;C for 5 min and subsequently place it on ice.",

    "This step may aid in the proper folding of the target mRNA and its binding to the RBP.",
    "The incubation time may have to be extended for low affinity RNA/protein interactions. ",
    "CRITICAL STEP To assess the background noise of the immunoprecipitation experiment \\(for example, RNA binding to protein-A Sepharose beads in the absence of a RBP/target mRNA interaction) a reaction should be set up in parallel in which the recombinant RBP is omitted or replaced by a mutant protein that is deficient in RNA binding.",
    "**8** On ice, combine the antibody protein-A Sepharose bead mixture \\(Step 4) and the protein-RNA mixture \\(Step 7) and incubate for 30 min at 4-10 &#xB0;C with tumbling end over end or shaking.",

    "Incubate for 45 min at 50 &#xB0;C with constant agitation to keep the beads in suspension.",
    "This step will separate the mRNAs from the RBPs and the beads.",
    "**12** Extract the RNA by adding one volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol to the beads \\(200 &#xB5;l) and to the supernatant fractions \\(600 &#xB5;l).",
    "Mix by vortexing and centrifuge \\(13000 rpm 1min) to separate the phases.",

    "**15**",
    "The RNA concentration is measured using a spectrophotometer.",
    "CRITICAL STEP",
    "While accurate determination of the amount of RNA in the SN fraction should be straight forward; low RNA concentrations are expected in the IP fractions that are difficult to quantify using conventional spectrophotometers.",
    "We have therefore commonly used the NanoDrop apparatus \\(www.nanodrop.com) that requires as little as 1 &#xB5;l of undiluted RNA. ",
