    "**Preparing Input Files**",
    "Mass spectrometry data must first be converted to one of the supported MS/MS input formats of MGF, mzXML, or mzML.",
    "A popular option for converting from vendor file inputs and between various input formats is Proteowizard \\(\"proteowizard.sourceforge.net\":http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net ).",
    "MSFragger determines the appropriate data parser to use based on the file extension \\(.mgf for MGF, .mzXML for mzXML, and .mzML for mzML) and does not make inferences from file contents \\(i.e.",
    "naming a mzML file with the .mzXML extension will lead to unpredictable results or crashes).",
    "The protein database must be supplied in FASTA format.",
    "MSFragger does not have the capability to generate decoys internally so they must be generated externally and appended to the protein database before running MSFragger.",
    "**Configuring MSFragger**",
    "Extract the MSFragger.jar into your working directory along with the sample configuration file called fragger.params.",
    "MSFragger is configured using a text parameters file.",
    "The parameters file is passed as the first argument to MSFragger and has no restrictions on names or file extensions \\(so one might want to name their configuration files to be more descriptive such as Uniprot_open_withmods.txt) after editing the parameters file for a particular analysis. ",
    "Parameter names are given left of the equal sign and parameter values are given to the right \\(e.g.",
    "num_threads",
    "= 4).",
    "White spaces are trimmed from the ends of each value by MSFragger.",
    "All text to the right of \\(and including) the # sign of each line is discarded so # can be used for comments in the parameters file.",
    "A detailed explanation of each parameter can be found in \"this PDF\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5227/original/MSFraggerParamGuide.pdf?1488158913.",
    "**Performance Considerations for Batch Processing**",
    "MSFragger allows multiple MS/MS input files to be processed in a batch.",
    "Passing multiple files to MSFragger at once allows MSFragger to reuse the fragment index for subsequent MS/MS run.",
    "This is particularly important for narrow window searches which may only take fractions of a second.",
    "On computers or compute clusters with many processor cores, we highly recommended that MSFragger is set to process files sequentially with all available processor cores rather than running multiple instances of MSFragger in parallel \\(assigning a smaller number of cores to each).",
    "This reduces initialization times and allows the fragment index to be re-used, at the same time reducing overall memory requirements.",
    "**Launching MSFragger**",
    "Ensure that you have placed MSFragger.jar in your working directory and have modified the parameters file to reference your protein database.",
    "MSFragger generates auxiliary files during database search so it is critical that **MSFragger must have write access to the directories containing the protein database AND the MS/MS data files**.",
    "Determine the amount of system memory available that you would like to make available to MSFragger.",
    "This will be specified by the Java maximum heap size parameter -Xmx \\(e.g.",
    "-Xmx3700M for 3700 MB or -Xmx8G for 8GB).",
    "MSFragger takes the first argument as the input parameters file, followed by a list of",
    "one or more MS/MS data files.",
    "Examples:",
    "java -Xmx8G -jar MSFragger.jar fragger.params HeLa_run1.mzML HeLa_run2.mzML",
    "java -Xmx8G -jar MSFragger.jar fragger.params *.mzML",
    "The **-Xmx flag is very important** to ensure that MSFragger has access to sufficient memory to efficiently perform the search as the default max heap setting in Java is 1/4 of total system memory \\(which is insufficient for optimal performance).",
    "We recommend that you can allocate a minimum of 4G or 6G for standard tryptic digestions."
