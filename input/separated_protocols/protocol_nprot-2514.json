    "The density of the cell is about 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> #/mL.",
    "To ensure the cells in dispersed state, the suspension is kept in a static state for about 10 minutes.",
    "4) Dilute the _",

    "**Fabrication of TFP:**",
    "1) Strip off the polymer jacket of the single-mode optical fibre with a fibre stripper, fabricate a bare fibre of 160-mm in length and 125-\u03bcm in diameter.",
    "2) Sheathe the bare fibre with a glass capillary.",
    "3) Light the alcohol lamp, seize the left and right parts of the bare fibre outside the capillary with left hand and the tweezers, respectively, make sure the bare fibre being heated by the outer flame of the alcohol lamp with a heating zone of about 2~3 mm.",

    "The fibre diameter is decreased from 125 to 10 \u03bcm with a length of about 2 mm.",
    "Then draw the fibre with a high speed at about 2 mm/s until the fibre broke with a sharply tapered end.",
    "Finally, a TFP is fabricated.",
    "4) Fix the TFP on the six-axis manipulator, and observe it under the microscope with different objectives.",

    "Move the TFP to get close to particles by adjusting the six-axis manipulator.",
    "3) Turn on the laser source, tune the knob on the laser source until the optical power displayed on the optical power meter is 2 mW. The particles beside the TFP axis will be trapped to the axis by the transverse optical gradient force as shown in Fig.",
    "2a-c.",
    "4) Increase the optical power displayed on the power meter to 4.5 mW.",
    "The particles along the TFP axis will be trapped and/or driven away by the dominant optical gradient force and scattering force, respectively, as shown in Fig.",
    "2d,e.",
    "5) Move the TFP in different directions, the trapped and driven particles can be manipulated flexibly in different directions, as shown in Fig.",
    "2f.",
    "6) Keep the optical power displayed on the power meter at 4.5 mW, and move the TFP until the particles are along the TFP axis but with different distances.",
    "You will see single particle being trapped or driven away \\(see Supplementary Video 1 and Video 2).",
    "Different manipulation distances \\(_D_<sub>M</sub>) for particles with different axial working distances \\(_D_<sub>A</sub>) and optical powers launched into the TFP are shown in Fig.",
    "3a and b, respectively.",
    "7) Tune the optical power displayed on the power meter at 2.8 mW, move the TFP to trap and pick up individual particles and deliver them to designated positions to form desired patterns \\(see Supplementary Video 3).",
    "8) Tune the optical power displayed on the optical power meter at 3.9 mW, move the TFP to drive particles to designated positions to form desired patterns \\(see Supplementary Video 4).",
    "9) Combine the abilities of trapping and driving, different patterns can be arranged as shown in Fig. 4.",
    "10) To manipulate sub-micron sized particles, using another clean glass slide and pipette a droplet of particle \\(0.7-\u03bcm-diameter silica) suspension \\(0.1 mL) on the slide, follow the procedure as described in 2) of section **Manipulation of particles and cells**.",
    "11) Turn on the laser source, tune the knob on the laser source until the optical power displayed on the power meter is 3.3 mW. The particle near the TFP tip will be trapped by the dominant optical gradient force as shown in Fig.",
