    "CRITICAL STEP Do not use ice-cold PBS, as this may inhibit respiration and thus interfere with ROS production.",
    "2. Dissect tissue of interest in 1XPBS in three well glass plates.\r\n  ",
    "CRITICAL STEP Do not dissect in Schneider's medium, as the presence of primary amines from the amino acids it contains can lead to extracellular hydrolysis of the dye.",
    "In addition, it is important to remove as much extraneous tissue as possible.",

    "CRITICAL STEP Vortexing for about 15 to 30 seconds is usually optimal.",
    "Excessive vortexing may hasten decomposition of the dye, as it is subject to hydrolysis; on the other hand, shorter vortexing times may result in incomplete dispersion of the dye, resulting in the deposition of colloids on the tissue.",

    "However, the mild fixation step described here facilitates analysis of ROS production in GFP marked clones, as completely unfixed GFP samples tend to produce clones with fuzzy boundaries.",
    "The length of the fixation is crucial, and may have to be determined empirically for the tissue of interest and particular variant of GFP used: too little fixation will produce fuzzy GFP boundaries but will significantly retain ROS signal, excessive fixation will produce clear GFP boundaries but will  compromise ROS signal.",
