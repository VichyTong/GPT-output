    "You have two input options \\(Figure 2): in the first option, you can upload a file and in the second option, you can paste your sequence.",
    "Click on the option which you want.",
    "In both these options, a single sequence must be provided in the FASTA format:  sequence information \\(see Equipment Setup section above) should be preceded by a line beginning with the &#x2018;&#x2018;&gt;&#x2019;&#x2019; sign followed by the sequence name.",
    "Multiple sequences cannot be processed by PURE because it is a very computer intensive method.",
