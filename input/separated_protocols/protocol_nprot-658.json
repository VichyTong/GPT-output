    "Preparation of reagent 2\\[7] ",
    "1] Add 40 mL diethyl ether to a 250 mL round bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar.",
    "2] Add 0.05 mL pyridine to the flask.",
    "3] Add 3.8 mL bromoacetyl bromide 4 to the flask, close the flask with a glass stopper.",
    "4] Put the flask on the ice-bath and turn on stirring. ",
    "5] Make a solution of 16 mL of diethyl ether, 2.9 mL of allyl alcohol \\(3) and 6.4 mL of triethyl amine.",
    "6]",
    "Equip the flask with a dropping funnel and add the mixture from 5] dropwise to the cooled solution of bromoacetyl bromide. ",
    "6] Stir for 30 min.",
    "7] Add an additional 20 mL of diethyl ether to the flask.",
    "8] Stir for an additional 3 h.",
    "9] Filter off the precipitate on a glass filter funnel.",
    "10] Evaporate the filtrate under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and purify further using vacuum distillation \\(Bp",
    "= 80 \u02daC at 15mm Hg).",
    "Synthesis of alkyne and azide functionalized nucleosides 5 and 6",
    "1] Add 269 mg of compound 1 to a 100 mL round bottomed flask",
    "2] Add 10 mL THF, and evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, repeat the procedure. ",
    "3] Add a magnetic stirrer bar and leave the compound for drying under vacuum for 30 min.",
    "4] Add 20 mL THF to the flask, close the flask with a glass tube \\(containing a stopcock) equipped with a balloon containing Ar \\(g), open the stopcock to flush the compound with argon.",
    "5] Add 73 mg of potassium t-butoxide while stirring, continue stirring for 30 min.",
    "6]",
    "Add 116 mg of allyl bromoacetate \\(2) and continue stirring for an additional 2 h.",
    "7] Remove the solvent by evaporation under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. ",
    "8] Dissolve the residue in 10 mL dry methanol and add 275 mg of propargyl amine \\(10eq), or alternatively 2-azidoethylamine, close the flask with a stopper and continue stirring at room temperature over night.",
    "9] Evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator.",
    "10] Dissolve the the residue in 1 mL of DCM and load it on the column \\(5g of Merck Silica gel 60, packed with DCM on a glass column).",
    "First use 200 mL DCM and then a stepwise gradient of methanol in DCM \\(from 1 to 10% methanol) to elute the compund.",
    "Collect fractions containing product and remove solvent under reduced pressure."
