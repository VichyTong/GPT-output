    "Glycochips \\(microchips printed with 577 different carbohydrate structures, Semiotik LLC Moscow, Russia) were incubated in an incubation chamber for 15 min at 25 \u00b0C with PBS plus 0.1% \\(v/v) Tween-20 \\(buffer 3) \\(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the buffer was then carefully removed from the microchip surface using Whatman\u00ae filter paper \\(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).",
    "\u03b1Gal-KO mouse serum was diluted \\(1:15) in PBS plus 1% \\(w/v) bovine serum albumin \\(BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1% \\(v/v) Tween-20 \\(buffer 1).",
    "Diluted serum was spread over the slide surface and incubated with agitation \\(30 rpm) at 37 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. After a round of washing steps with buffer 3, buffer 4 \\(PBS with 0.001% v/v Tween-20), and distilled water \\(Milli-Q grade), the glycochips were drained by mild centrifugation \\(1 min, 175g, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).",
    "The glycochips were then incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C \\(30 rpm) with goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM \\(H+L) conjugated to biotin \\(Thermo",

    "The unbound fraction was removed by repeating the same round of washing steps.",
    "Glass slides were incubated in darkness at 25 \u00b0C for 45 min \\(30 rpm) with streptavidin labeled with Cy5 dye \\(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) and diluted 1:500 in buffer 2.",
    "After another round of washing, the glycochips were dried by airflow in darkness.",
    "Finally, the glycochips were scanned using a ScanArray GX Plus scanner \\(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) with a laser \\(excitation wavelength of 633 nm).",
    "All data analysis was performed with the ScanArray\u00ae Express Microarray Analysis System \\(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).",
    "Interactive exploration of multidimensional data \\(heat mapping and clustering analysis) was performed with the Hierarchical Clustering Explorer \\(HCE) application developed by the University of Maryland, Maryland, USA \\(http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hce/)."
