    "1. Inoculate single colony of _P. aeruginosa_ and _S. aureus_ into 10 ml each of Luria-Bertani \\(LB) broth and Tryptone Soy Broth \\(TSB), respectively, and shake the culture at 200 rpm for 16 h at 37 &#xBA;C.  \r\n  2.",
    "For _P. aeruginosa_, in order to induce the production of PAE, dilute the overnight cultures of PAO-Iglewski and PAO-B1A1 with LB broth to 10<sup>3</sup> cfu/ml, and incubate as standing cultures at 37 &#xBA;C for 48 h<sup>1</sup>. \r\n  ",
