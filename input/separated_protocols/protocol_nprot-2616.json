    "1. Preparation of engineered graphene films\r\n  a.",
    "The graphene film was obtained by filtration of solvent dispersed graphene sheets at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.",
    "b.",
    "The selected area of graphene film was scanned with pulsed nitrogen laser with wavelength of 337 nm \\(200 Hz).",
    "It\u2019s noted the area can be adjusted.",
    "c.",
    "The spot-to-spot distance was set to be 30 \u00b5m and 500 shots were taken at each spot.",
    "The laser intensity was set to be 50% \\(about 121.8 \u00b5J for 100%).",
    "2.",
    "Preparation of micro-patterns\r\n  a. Diluted analytes \\(DOTAP) solutions were prepared in a step-wise manner.",
    "The solution should be stocked in -20 \u00baC fridge before use.",
    "b.",
    "The stamp \\(Figure 1a) was dipped into the solution and then pressed onto the engineered graphene film to mark the pattern.",
    "It\u2019s noted that such pattern is invisible on the stamped paper \\(Figure 1b) and can only be subsequently constructed by 2D matrix-free MS imaging technique.",
    "3. Matrix-free LDI MS imaging\r\n  a.",
    "In the imaging set up, the spot-to-spot distance was set to be 50 \u00b5m and 50 laser shots were taken with laser intensity of 36% at each spot.  ",
    "The nitrogen laser \\(337 nm) was applied at a repetition rate of 200 Hz.",
    "A full mass spectrum ranging from 200 to 2000 m/z was acquired for every pixel at an x-y step-size of 50 \u03bcm.",
    "b.",
    "Imaging data was stored in the FlexImaging data format \\(Bruker Bioscience).",
    "2D image construction and statistical analysis were executed using custom-made scripts in the FlexImaging software \\(Bruker Biosicence, AUS).",
    "Peak finding and integration was performed for each pixel to select peaks at specific m/z of 380 and 662.",
    "Peaks were integrated using a 0.3 Da window."
