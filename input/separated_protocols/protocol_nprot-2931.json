    "Here we report a method that is able to numerically quantify the intensity of a chromogen stain in IHC under bright field microscopy.  ",
    "Standard red-green-blue \\(RGB) color images acquired from bright field microscopy have a maximum intensity of value 250 \\(represented by white, unstained areas) as measured by the standard intensity function in the open source Fiji software \\(ImageJ) \\(http://fiji.sc/Fiji).  ",
    "Stained areas, as marked by either a nuclear counterstain such as hematoxylin or the chromogen, appear to the human eye as varying degrees of coloration; the more antigen-chromogen present, the darker the area appears.  ",
    "However, darker areas have lower intensity values, resulting in an inverse correlation between the amount of antigen and its numerical value.  ",
    "This is counterintuitive and cumbersome for the purposes of data analysis.  ",
    "One way around this dilemma is to measure the \u201creciprocal intensity\u201d of the stained area.  ",
    "Since the maximum intensity value of an RGB image analyzed in ImageJ is 250, we can subtract the intensity of a stained region of interest \\(ROI) from 250, thereby deriving a reciprocal intensity that is directly proportional to the amount of chromogen present \\(Figure 1).  ",
    "The maximum intensity value of 250 is somewhat arbitrary, since it serves as a reference from which reciprocal intensities are derived.  ",
    "Therefore this maximum point should be reasonably selected and systematically applied to all measurements in a data set.  ",
    "This is relevant to images that were not white balanced prior to image capture or were edited for contrast afterwards.  ",
    "As proof of principle, we first quantified the reciprocal intensity of nuclear-localized ER in this tumor model \\(Figure 2A) using the open source Fiji \\(ImageJ) software \\(http://fiji.sc/Fiji).  ",
    "A uniformly sized region of interest was placed over each nuclei using the draw tool \\(Figure 2B-D), and the mean intensity was measured using the \u201cMeasure\u201d function under the \u201cAnalyze\u201d menu of Fiji \\[Note: desired outputs of the measure function \\(i.e.",
    "mean intensity, area, etc.) can be specified in the \u201cSet Measurements\u2026\u201d option under the \u201cAnalyze\u201d menu.].  ",
    "ER was expressed to varying degrees in the nuclei, ranging from no staining \\(Figure 2B), to moderate staining \\(Figure 2C), to dark staining \\(Figure 2D).  ",
    "Reciprocal intensities directly correlated with increasing staining intensity \\(Figure 2E) \\(ANOVA, p<0.0001)."
