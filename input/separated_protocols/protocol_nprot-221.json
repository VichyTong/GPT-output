    "Six of these clones obtained can be expanded in serum-free media and then tested for their potential to differentiate.",
    "The stem/progenitor cells tend to aggregate when maintained in serum free media, but in the presence of 20% FBS the cells expand to form single cell layers and start differentiating."
