    "**General Note**",
    "We recommend to first attempt a selectable gene disruption of the target gene \\(using SLI-TGD) to assess its importance for parasite growth before embarking on inducible methods of target inactivation \\(knock sideways or diCre based gene-excision).",
    "**Procedure for selection linked integration**",
    "For localisation and knock sideways, clone the last 500 \u2013 1000 bp of your target gene \\(start the sequence with an in-frame stop codon",
    "but omit the stop at the end of the gene) into pSLI-sandwich \\(this plasmid usually is superior to pSLI-2xFKBP-GFP).",
    "For selectable gene disruption clone ~250 \u2013 500 bp of your target gene into pSLI-TGD.",
    "The chosen sequence should be situated in the 5\u2019 coding sequence of the target gene and should also start with an in-frame stop codon \\(see Figure 1). ",

    "From the parental culture prepare a 5 ml dish \\(60 x 15mm) with a parasitemia of 1 - 4 % and a hematocrit of 5% without WR99210.",
    "Add 40 \u00b5l of G418 solution \\(400 \u00b5g/ml final) to start selection for integrants.",
    "In the case of SLI-TGD, prepare three 5 ml culture dishes in parallel for G418 selection and if no correct integration is obtained in these cultures, repeat once \\(resulting in 6 total attempts)\r\n  ",
    "5. Change medium daily for the first 10 days, from then on every other day.",
    "Prepare Giemsa smears the first 3 days after starting selection to ensure that parasites do not overgrow.",

    "Parasites will disappear usually before day 10 after Neomycin selection.",
    "Note that occasionally integrants are obtained before day 10.",

    "If the PCR integration check did not show positive bands for the 5\u2018 and 3\u2018 integration junction, C-terminal fusion may ablate the function of the target protein.",

    "1.",
    "Transfect 50 \u00b5g of mislocaliser plasmid DNA into the knock-in integration cell line created with pSLI-sandwich \\(preferable) or pSLI-2xFKBP-GFP; use the nuclear mislocaliser \\(p1xNLS-FRB-mCherry) for targets outside of the nucleus and the PPM mislocaliser  \\(pLyn-FRB-mCherry) for nuclear targets \r\n  2.",
