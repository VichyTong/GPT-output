    "A. Purification of initiation factors IF1 and IF2",
    "1.",
    "The over-expression of the IFs is performed according to Gualerzi &amp; Pon, 1990, with some modification included here.",
    "From 1 liter of culture, 3.5g of cell are harvested and washed in lysis buffer by centrifugation \\(Sorvall GSA rotor, 4000rpm) for 30 min at 4&#x2DA;C.\r\n  2.",
    "Cells are re-suspended in lysis buffer containing DNase",
    "I \\(10&#x3BC;g/ml) and fresh PMSF, cracked in a French Pressure cell \\(10-1500 psi) and cell debris are removed by centrifugation \\(Beckman JLA16.250 rotor) at 12 Krpm for 30 min at 4&#x2DA;C, resulting in the S30 fraction.",
    "Finally, ribosomes are removed from the supernatant \\(S30) by ultracentrifugation \\(Beckman coulter Ti 50.2 rotor) at 45Krpm for 2.5 hours at 4&#x2DA;C producing an S100 fraction.\r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "The S100 fraction is applied to a Q Sepharose&#x2122; Fast Flow column \\(26/10, 6 ml/min flow rate) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with 120ml of buffer A, bound proteins are eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 1 M NaCl \\(total volume 900 ml), and 12 ml fractions are collected.",
    "Then an SDS-PAGE analysis is performed in order to identify the fractions containing the pure IF that can be pooled together.\r\n  ",
    "4. Heating the pool of the Q-sepharose run at 65&#x2DA;C for 20&#x2019;, followed by a step on ice for 20 min, allows to denaturate most of the contaminating E. coli proteins that can then be removed by centrifugation \\(Beckman JLA16.250 rotor) at 12 Krpm for 30 min at 4&#x2DA;C.\r\n  6.",
    "For further purification, a phenyl-sepharose FF column \\(HighprepTM 16/10, 4 ml/min flow rate) is used.",
    "This anion exchange chromatography step requires adding solid \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to the sample in order to reach a final concentration of 1M.",
    "The supernatant depleted of contaminating E. coli proteins is applied to a phenyl-sepharose FF column pre-equilibrated with buffer C, and protein elution is performed with a linear gradient of 220 ml from 1 to 0 M of \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.",
    "Presence and quality of the purified IFs is determined by PAGE-SDS and the concentration by UV absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients 26025 M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> for IF2 and 5960 M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> for IF1.\r\n  ",
    "7.",
    "Fractions containing IFs are pooled and the proteins precipitated by addition of solid \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to 70% saturation.",
    "When fresh samples are required for structural studies, an aliquot of the precipitate is collected by centrifugation \\(Beckman JLA16.250 rotor) and dissolved in the buffer E.",
    "The sample is applied to Superdex-75 10/300",
    "GL column \\(GE healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer E, and the fractions collected are checked by SDS-PAGE analysis.",
    "The integrity of IF1 and IF2 was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectroscopy \\(MALDI/MS).\r\n  ",
    "B. Nitrocellulose filter-binding assay",
    "Using the following protocol, the stability of 30S and 70S initiation complexes can be tested in order to obtain homogeneous complexes for cryo-EM studies \\(Myasnikov _et al_., 2005; Simonetti _et al_., 2008, in press).",
    "Before starting the filter-binding assay, the 30S ribosomal subunits are activated in buffer F at 37&#xB0;C for 30 minutes.",
    "After ribosome activation the reaction mixture is prepared as follows:",
    "1.",
    "Each reaction mixture contains \\(in 15 &#xB5;l of buffer F) 0.5 mM GTP, 9 pmoles \\(0.6 &#xB5;M) of T. thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunits and, unless the activity of one of the initiation factors is to be tested, 13.5 pmoles \\(0.9 &#xB5;M) each of IF1, IF2, and IF3. \r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "The binding reaction is started by the addition of 13.5 pmoles \\(0.9 &#xB5;M) each of mRNA and f\\[35S]Met-tRNAfMet.\r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "After 10 min incubation at 50&#xB0;C, the reaction was stopped by dilution 1:70 in buffer F  and the amount of ribosome-bound f\\[35S]Met-tRNAfMet is determined by filtering each reaction mixture through nitrocellulose discs.\r\n  ",
    "Preparation and purification of tRNAfMet was performed as described by Dutka _et al_., 1993, and aminoacylation and formylation of tRNAfMet  was perfomed as described by Milon _et al_., 2007."
