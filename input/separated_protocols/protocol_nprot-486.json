    "For the fold type prediction, the output is one the 26 fold types described in <sup>23</sup>.",
    "For the structural class prediction, the output is one of the four structural classes \\(all-&#xF061;, all-&#xF062;, &#xF061;/&#xF062;, and &#xF061;+&#xF062;).",
    "In the case of the secondary structure content prediction, the output is two real values which represent the helix and the strand contents, respectively.",
    "The cross-evaluation results include the secondary structure contents of helix and strand re-predicted by _iFC<sup>2</sup>_ server \\(which is potentially different from the predictions of PSSC-core<sup>9</sup>), the output label provided by _iFC<sup>2</sup>_ server which flags the prediction of SCEC as potentially correct or incorrect, and the label generated by _iFC<sup>2</sup>_ server that annotates the prediction of PFRES as potentially correct or incorrect."
