    "**Preparing the flies**",
    "1) Set up fly crosses.",
    "2) Collect newly hatched females of the correct genotype daily and place them into fresh vial with yeast with equal amount of males to ensure continued production of eggs.",
    "Avoid overcrowding the vials.",
    "To generate partial clones place collected flies in empty fly vial and heat shock for 10 minutes in water bath at 37&#xB0;C. Flies should be heat shocked as soon as possible after hatching \\(see troubleshooting).",
    "Store flies at 25&#xB0;C. Heat shocked flies for clonal analysis should be placed to fresh yeast every day until imaged \\(generally from 2 to 5 days after the heat shock).",
    "3) Place 2 or 3 days old females to wet yeast 2 or 3 days prior dissecting.",
    "For clonal analysis, we use flies 2 or 3 days after adult heat shock, which gives a good rate of partial clones.",
    "For full border cell clusters, either heat shock as larvae \\(three consecutive 1 h heat shocks every 12h for 2nd-3rd instar larvae) or leave flies for 4-5 days after adult heat shock.",
    "We find the identification of mutant cells easiest if the MARCM system6 is used, however it is also possible to use the conventional FRT system.",
    "**Preparing the imaging dishes and media**",
    "4) Pipette 150 &#x3BC;l of 0.1 mg/ml Poly-D-Lysine into each well of a LabTek chamber and incubate at 37&#xB0;C for 1 to 2 hours.",
    "Remove poly-Lysine \\(can be stored at -20&#xB0;C and re-used).",
    "Wash coated dishes 4x with water and aspirate.",
    "Freshly coated dishes can be used immediately for imaging or alternatively stored at -20&#xB0;C at least for one month.",
    "5) Prepare dissection and culture media",
    "Prepare culture media fresh each day.",

    "Immediately before imaging, take 200&#x3BC;l, and add ~0.6&#x3BC;l FM4-64.",
    "Each well requires 200&#x3BC;l of media, so scale accordingly.",

    "**Dissection of egg chambers**",
    "6) Pull out ovaries with fine dissecting forceps from 1-2 anesthetized females in about 500 &#x3BC;l of dissecting medium in glass dissecting chamber.",
    "We use carbon dioxide to anesthetize individual flies and we try to minimize the time they are anesthetized.",
    "7) Transfer the ovaries into a new well with fresh dissecting medium.",
    "And use fine dissection pins to open up the ovaries and detach strings of ovarioles from each other.",
    "Select an ovariole that contains an appropriate staged egg chamber.",
    "\\(Figure 1a) ",
    "8) Dissect single egg chambers of appropriate stages out from the muscle sheath and remove older and younger egg chambers.",
    "Dissociating the ovarioles will sometimes remove the muscle sheath.",
    "Chains without the muscle sheath are easily identifiable as the egg chambers are less tightly packed  \\(see Figure 1).",
    "In either case, start by removing older stage egg chambers from the chain.",
    "The muscle sheath will often roll off once the older egg chambers are removed.",
    "Use the two needles in a scissoring action.",
    "\\(see Figure 1).",
    "To minimize damage, place the blunter pin near the target egg chamber, then quickly drag the tungsten needle past it on the other side.",
    "We find that separating the egg chambers in this way minimizes damage to the target egg chamber.",
    "Repeat this process to remove the younger egg chambers in the chain.",
    "Again, the blunter needle should be closest to the target egg chamber.",
    "It is not strictly necessary to remove all of the younger egg chambers, but we find that single egg chambers tend to lie better in the imaging chamber.",
    "Also some muscle sheath often remains on very young egg chambers, which causes the chain to move during imaging.",
    "Learn how to distinguish the appropriate stages of egg chambers with dissecting microscope.",
    "Good markers are the relative size of oocyte compared to the whole the egg chamber, whether the oocyte has started to uptake yolk \\(becoming more opaque), and whether nurse cells are transparent or opaque,  \\(due to lipid droplet accumulation).",
    "We find that placing the dish on a black background helps, also illuminating the dish from above or the side makes stage discrimination easier.",
    "9) Transfer single dissected egg chambers into new well with dissecting medium, avoid debris.",
    "A pipette with a 2&#x3BC;l or 20&#x3BC;l tip can be used to transfer the egg chambers. ",
    "10) Wash the egg chambers once more with medium, select the 5-10 nicest ones of correct stage and transfer them into poly-D-lysine coated imaging chamber.",
    "Total volume of about 10 &#x3BC;l is enough for transferring.",
    "11) Let egg chambers briefly adhere \\(approximately 5-10 seconds) and then carefully add 200 &#x3BC;l of imaging medium supplemented with FM4-64 just before use. ",
    "Dissection time should be limited to 15 minutes.",
    "Egg chambers can be maintained for approximately 3 hours in imaging media before morphological defects appear.",
    "As the dissection media lacks most of the additives, the time egg chambers spend it in should be minimized.  ",

    "By using transmission and FM4-64 channels choose healthy looking egg chambers for imaging.",
    "For border cell migration, choose egg chambers, where border cells have clearly delaminated or are already migrating.",
    "Use FM4-64 as an indicator of damage and exclude egg chambers if any nurse cells or follicle cells show greatly increased FM 4-64 uptake compared to their neighbors \\(indicating damage during dissection).",
    "See figure 2.",
    "Also egg chambers that take up FM4-64 very badly are likely to be unhealthy.",
    "Quite often in those cases the transmission channel will also shows that nurse cell cytoplasm is filled with vesicles and appears granular \\(in many cases, however, this becomes apparent only after some time).",
    "13) Set up the microscope.",
    "We generally use 40x oil objective, which is convenient if motorized stage is used.",
    "Water and glycerol objectives are giving deeper working distance but one should keep in mind that water will evaporate during imaging.",
    "FM4-64 can be excitated by using a 488 laser line, which allows simultaneous excitation and capturing of GFP, FM4-64 and DIC channels.",
    "Choose 3 to 8 good looking egg chambers \\(use DIC and FM4-64 to asses the healthiness of egg chambers), and mark their position with stage tool.",
    "Set up the plane where border cells are as a middle point of your future z stack.",
    "Begin imaging. ",
    "We have successfully been taking 7 z positions from each egg chamber every 2 minutes for 2,5 hours.",
    "We have not observed significant problems with phototoxicity during imaging at laser intensities where FM4-64 is clearly visible.",
    "High intensity, localized excitation may cause some toxicity.",
    "It is important to check the morphology of egg chambers after imaging to control for this.",
    "14) Image processing.",
    "We use the Zeiss browser to review and project timelapses and ImageJ for further processing.",
    "We assess the following basic characteristics in movie:",
    "&#x2022; The egg chamber should increase in size during imaging",
    "&#x2022; The oocyte should grow",
    "&#x2022; The follicle cell layer should retract towards the oocyte",
    "&#x2022; Nurse cell nuclei should display some movement ",
    "&#x2022; Nurse cell membranes should be tightly adhered ",
    "We deem a movie to have &#x2018;ended&#x2019; when the nurse cell nuclei stop moving, the nurse cell membranes become highly detached and nurse cells adopt a rounded shape.",
