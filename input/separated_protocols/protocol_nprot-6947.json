    "**Scheduled Spawning of adult lobate ctenophores**",
    "This is a modification of a protocol that was established for adult _Mnemiopsis leidyi_ collected in the waters of Woods Hole MA.",
    "described previously<sup>28\u201331</sup>.",
    "Despite numerous attempts, it has been difficult to manipulate the time of spawning in Woods Hole collected adults.",
    "Here we describe a protocol to be able to spawn adult _Mnemiopsis leidyi_",
    "at the Whitney Lab for Marine Bioscience and in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.",
    "1. Adult _",
    "M. leidyi_ were collected with beakers by \u2018dipping\u2019 them out of the water from floating docks in the Intercostal Waterway around the town of Marineland, Florida and Eel Pond in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.",
    "Care must be taken to avoid touching specimens with nets or bare hands because damage their outer epidermis.\r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "Using a glass or plastic beaker, transfer adults into a 5-gallon plastic bucket filled with natural 1\u00b5m UV-filtered fresh seawater \\(1x UV-FSW), or equivalent \\(Figure 1).\r\n  ",
    "3. Keep the bucket inside the lab at room temperature under constant light for at least two consecutive nights before spawning.",
    "It is recommendable to use a 20-Watt LED Floodlight, or similar, placed at the top of the bucket \\(Figure 1A-C).",
    "Exposure to constant light is required in order to neutralize the endogenous circadian periodicity of spawning of wild-caught animals.\r\n  ",
    "Note: Under these conditions, animals will stay healthy for up to a week, although their oral lobes will begin regressing without wild plankton feeding.",
    "Feeding animals with recently hatched Artemia \\(Figure 1D and 1d\u2019)",
    "the day before spawning improves gamete production.",
    "Feeding animals constantly with mysid shrimps \\(or equivalent local copepods)",
    "improves animal health and gamete production.",
    "Move the animals to a clean bucket of FSW when water becomes turbid.",
    "4.",
    "When spawning is desired, take 1-2 adult _M. leidyi_ from the bucket and place them into a new container \\(e.g. 6\u201d diameter glass bowls; Figure 1E) with fresh 1\u00b5m UV-FSW.",
    "Having clean water is essential in order to keep spawned embryos free of debris.",
    "_",
    "M. leidyi_ are self-fertile adults and viable embryos can be obtained from the spawning of a single individual<sup>12,28,31</sup>.\r\n  ",
    "Note: Be careful not to touch the animals directly.",
    "Rather use glass or plastic beakers to perform the transfer.",
    "5. Place the bowls containing 1-2 animals into complete darkness \\(e.g.",
    "in an incubator, drawer, or under a cardboard box) and wait for the spawning.",
    "After 1-2 hours quickly check the bowls for early spawning.",
    "If gametes are detected, transfer the animals to a clean bowl with fresh 1x FSW.",
    "This will help ensure that subsequently spawned eggs will develop synchronously.\r\n  ",
    "6.",
    "After 3 hours in darkness, animals will start to release sperm and then, between 10 to 20 minutes later, they will release the eggs.",
    "Eggs are fertilized as soon as they are released<sup>12,28,31</sup>.\r\n  ",
    "Note: Keep animals in dark during spawning.",
    "Waiting times vary according to different seasons and locations.",

    "Ctenophore embryos at stages prior to hatching:_",
    "Ctenophore embryos like _M. leidyi_ are surrounded by an acellular chorion.",
    "A jelly coat surrounds the chorion at spawning causing them to have neutral buoyancy.",
    "After 5-10 minutes, the external jelly coat dissolves and the fertilized eggs will sink to the bottom of the dish.",
    "There is also a jelly-like substance located in the vitelline space, \\(between the chorion and the egg surface).",
    "This substance changes its properties after fixation.",
    "Dechorionated ctenophore embryos will stick to polystyrene plastic.",
    "Dechorionated ctenophores embryos can be raised on gelatin-coated dishes<sup>28</sup>.",

    "Gastrula \\(and later) stages can be dechorionated by gently pipetting fixed embryos up and down through a P-200 micropipette tip.",
    "Slightly addition of Triton X-100 \\(up to 0.5%) may facilitate the dechorionation process but it can decrease cell and tissue preservation.",
    "6. Rinse the fixed embryos at least five times in PBT for at least 3 hours on a rocking platform at room temperature.",
    "It is recommendable to do one first quick wash of 5 minutes, the second one of 25 minutes, and three washes of 50 minutes each.\r\n  ",

    "The fixation of larvae and adult ctenophore tissues has been a long-standing challenge for molecular and cellular biology studies.",
    "The massive amount of mesoglea with different osmotic properties maintains the homeostasis and structural integrity of the thin outer cellular tissue in sea water.",
    "However, osmotic changes generated by fixative solutions disrupt this homeostasis, the mesoglea collapses, and the animals disintegrate into the solution inducing cellular degradation.",
    "To overcome this technical problem, we developed a simple method to preserve not only the cellular structure but also the animal integrity after fixation.",
    "1. Embed the live specimens in a pre-warmed \\(over 30\u00baC) low melt agar \\(1.2% in 1x FSW; Figure 3). \r\n  ",

    "A good way to avoid this is to pipette some agar to the side of the water containing the specimens \\(Figure 3B), then, pipette up the agar with the specimens, and mix the solutions by gently pipetting up and down two to three times \\(Figure 3C).",
