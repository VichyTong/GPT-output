    "The AutoMotif Server \\(AMS) dissects a query protein sequence into overlapping short sequence segments and identifies selected types of post-translational modification sites.",
    "We use supervised SVM classification trained on experimental knowledge for identification of PTM sites.",
    "Each sequence segment has assigned a real number calculated by the cost function of SVM classification model.",
    "Residues with have the value of cost function, i.e. the score larger than a given cut-off value are identified as possible modification sites.",
    "This means that the point representing this sequence segment is located in the region of multidimensional space classified as &#x201C;positive&#x201D; by the SVM model&#x2019;s hyperplane within given cut-off value.",
    "In AMS web server we use only single, the most effective type of the kernel, i.e. the polynomial kernel.",
    "The one-vote-wins method is used to annotate segments that are predicted as positives by at least one classification model. \r\n  ",
    "2.",
    "The AMS server accepts input sequences in the one-letter mode in capital letters:  'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY', with additional letter X for marking empty or unknown positions in a protein sequence, or extension of a sequence segment.",
    "Users can input sequences by submiting text file in FASTA file format \\(for details see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasta_format ), or by providing the SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL identifier or accession number in the text box, or simly pasting the amino acids seqeuences.",
    "\r\n  ",
    "3.",
    "The server predicts by default all types of post-translational modification sites that were precalculated by the authors and which are available with enough statistics in the Swiss-Prot database.",
    "The list presently include acetylation, amidation, hydroxylation, methylation, sulfation and phopshorylation \\(by PKC, PKA, CK, CK2 and CDC2 protein kinases).",
    "The search can be limited by selecting particular type of functional motif from the drop-down menu on the server&#x2019;s www page \\(for example phosphorylation sites in general or by specific kinases). \r\n  ",
    "4.",
    "Two types of search procedures are available on the server: the identity search and scan based on SVM classification.",
    "The first method identifies identical in terms of sequence 9 residues segments in a query protein and the database of positives for that selected type of modification.",
    "The second method runs several versions of SVM predictions that use different projection methods.",
    "The registration of a user \\(by following the link &#x201D;User Site&#x201D; from the main www page) allows for submiting his or her own list of training instances as a text file with the set of segments dissected from a multiple proteins known to pefrorm certain function.",
    "Then the AMS server train the SVM for the new type of functional motif and use it to scan any query protein sequence for potential substrates.",
    "This method allows for indroducing new types of biochemical process that are not yet known in public, or that are not contained in Swiss-Prot database .\r\n  ",
    "5.",
    "The output www page for a query protein contains two sections.",
    "The first section displays results of predictions for each selected model, i.e. the parent protein information \\(i.e.",
    "the sequence number in a query set), local segment sequences predicted as a modificated sites, their positions \\(start, modified central residue, the end position, and the size of a segment) and the output scores.",
    "The second section of the output www page describes each used type of post-translational modification, its protein agent, the best SVM method used to classify known instances.",
    "Each SVM model is described by the number of positive and negative instances used in training, the precision and recall errors of the classification models. \r\n  ",
    "6.",
    "The accuracy of SVM classification models is described by two numbers: the recall R and the precision P.",
    "The recall R value measures the percentage of correct predictions \\(the probability of correct prediction), whereas precision P gives the percentage of observed positives that are correctly predicted \\(the measure of the reliability of positive instances prediction).",
    "The measures of accuracy are calculated separately for each type of PTM using the leave-one-out procedure.",
    "The typical recall value is around 30%, and the precision P is over 70% for majority of PTM.\r\n  ",
    "7.",
    "In the case of single query protein applying the computational protocol give for each type of PTM the list of predicted modifications for this sequence.",
    "When a set of sequences is used as an input, the protocol returns the for each type of modification the list of predicted short sequence fragments that are modified with the parent protein number.",
    "The list of predicted modified sites is not ordered. \r\n  ",
    "8.",
    "The consensus prediction is also available on the output web page, when several different versions of the method predict the same local sequence fragment to perform given post-translational modification."
