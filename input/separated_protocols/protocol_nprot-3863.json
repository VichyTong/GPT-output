    "The emerging problem with inadvertent pro/anti-inflammatory intestinal effects due to gut microbiota relates to flora divergence among mice that have been raised in cages for long periods of time.",
    "During housing the gut microbiota can drift or shift due to primarily contaminated \\(partly irradiated) food or environmental contamination.  ",
    "Be aware that commercial irradiated rodent diets are not sterile, and therefore a common source for flora divergence.",
    "The goal of this protocol is to homogenize/expose all animals to a pool of mouse fecal microbiota \\(flora) created by combining fresh feces from all mice and 7-day old bedding flora from all cages from which experimental mice derive.",
    "The following set up of mice can be done to determine changes in the 16S flora in animals have diverse genotypes or if they originate from different colonies.",
    "In our laboratory, we also do fecal homogenization \\(IsPreFeH) 5-7 days prior to the start of DSS-experiments. ",
    "**The protocol steps are as follow.",
    "**  ",
    "1.",
    "Using an example of 6 mice per group to compare WT mice to their respective KO group, get 6 mice from each colony, one mouse per cage if possible for each colony, and one fecal pellet per mouse. \r\n  ",
    "2. Get equal amount of males and females from each colony.\r\n  ",
    "3. Identify in each cage the corner where mice piled their excrements, and collect a handful \\(~200 g, a handful) of full thickness soiled bedding material from each source cage. \r\n  ",
    "4.",
    "Pool all cage bedding material in one single empty autoclaved cage to create a bedding slurry by mixing the beddings with sterile PBS in sufficient volume to soften the dry fecal pellets and to create a thick fecal slurry.",
    "This will allow the homogenization of flora that is resistant to desiccation or that live/amplify in the dry feces and/or moist bedding of each cage environment where mice live.\r\n  ",
    "5. Take samples to the laboratory and prepare the fecal inoculum.",
    "Put all pellets \\(_e.g.,_ n=6+6) in a 15 mL tube with 9-10 mL of PBS, and about 500 mg of ceramica or glass beads, to facilitate the physical disruption of pellets.",
    "Use a larger 50 mL tube if more animal samples are being homogenized.",
    "Vortex to break pellets/homogenize, and spin tube at 500-1000 g for 5 \\(or 10) seconds to decant heavy particles; transfer the supernatant using a syringe and a gavage needle to a new tube.",
    "Do not centrifuge at higher speeds, or longer times, as this will differentially precipitate first spore-forming cells and then vegetative microorganisms.  ",
    "Extended high-speed centrifugation may render a supernatant free of bacterial/fungal microorganisms.  \r\n  ",
    "6. Prepare the bedding inoculum.",
    "After pooling all bedding material and soaking it with PBS, massage the samples manually \\(wearing two pairs of gloves) and create a slurry; hand squeeze the bedding, and collect the liquid into 15 mL tubes.",
    "If storage of this material is desired for ulterior experiments, load 10 mL of slurry in each tube for freezing and banking at -80<sup>o</sup>C.  Spin the pooled bedding suspension for 500-1000 g for 5 \\(or 10) seconds and transfer the supernatant using a syringe and a gavage needle to a new tube.\r\n  ",
    "7. Prepare the new cages by placing a handful \\(~200 g) of the homogenized soaked bedding material \\(not the bedding suspension) on the cage floor to allow mice to have physical exposure to a pool of bedding material.  \r\n  ",
    "8.",
    "Administer via gavage 200-400 \u03bcL of a combination of bedding:feces \\(1:1, v/v) supernatants/suspensions to each mouse on day one and cage them individually or in groups using fresh sterile bedding.  ",
    "Use autoclaved or sterile-irradiated food for the duration of the experiment.",
    "If 400 \u03bcL of suspension are to be gavaged \\(which is ideal to better buffer stomach acidity), fast the mice for 3-6 h to allow stomach emptying and promote rapid stomach transit of the gavaged suspension into the small intestine.  \r\n  ",
    "9. Consult your IACUC veterinarian for autoclaving protocols of approved rodent diets.",
    "If irradiated diets are preferred, use double-irradiated vacuum and sterile packed diets.",
    "If not feasible or if sterility is to be ensured, we use specially balanced laboratory autoclavable rodent diets \\(_e.g.,_ LabDiets, cat. 5010; autoclave following manufacturer\u2019s instruction or at 121<sup>o</sup>C for 30-45 minutes, in food layers of <3 inches thick), which is enriched with nutrients and have silicon dioxide to prevent pellet agglomeration during autoclaving.",
    "Although silicon dioxide is a common food additive, widely deemed to be inert, please determine if its use would interfere with the experimental results.  \r\n  ",
    "10.",
    "Replace the bedding and gavage the mice again on day 2 and 3. \r\n  11.",
    "Monitor the mice for additional 4 days changing the bedding once daily, and collect fecal samples for 16S analysis if desired to assess microbiome similarity or divergence, and start phenotyping experiments; for instance response to DSS-administration in the drinking water.",
    "Different waiting periods are possible, depending on the study objective.  ",
    "Because fecal transplantation in humans with Clostridium difficile infections has been successful in reestablishing the gut microbiota in >95% of transplanted patients \\(and antibiotic treated mice), alternatively, the IsPreFeH could be conducted two days after oral antibiotic treatment of the mice using a non-absorbable antimicrobial agent, _e.g.,_ streptomycin \\(20 mg/kg, widely known for disrupting gut microbiota and facilitating the establishment of severe Salmonella clinical infections in mice, which is not possible without antibiotic flora disruption).",
