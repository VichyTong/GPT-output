    "<p>We present a detailed protocol describing: (i) Plating of no more than 200-500 colonies/ 10cm plate (1 hour/ 100 plates) (ii) Incubation of plates until colonies form (at 30\u00b0C for 5-7 days); (iii) Imaging of plates (30min/ 100 plates); and (iii) running the automated pipeline described in (Carl <em>et al; </em>bioRxiv, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/801845) on the obtained images (20min/100 images).",
