    "6] Transfer 45 mL dry THF to the pear-shaped flask with a glass-syringe fitted with a 21 gauge needle.",
    "Swirl the flask by hand until all the _N_-Boc pyrrole has fully dissolved into the THF.",
    "7] Add the solution of pyrrole in THF in a dropwise fashion \\(approx.",
    "10 min) into the reaction flask using a glass-syringe fitted with a 21 gauge needle.",
    "Maintain vigorous stirring during the addition and ensure that the bath temperature is kept at &#x2212;78 &#xB0;C by addition of dry ice and acetone as required.",
    "8] Continue stirring for 3 hours at &#x2212;78 &#xB0;C. ",

    "The temperature of the bath should be monitored using a thermometer in the dewar dish.",
    "12]",
    "Cannular the entire contents of the reaction mixture into the methyl chloroformate solution in a dropwise fashion \\(approx.",
    "2 hours).",
    "The cannular should be cooled by wrapping it in a cotton wool jacket packed with dry ice.",
    "Maintain vigorous stirring during the addition and ensure that the bath temperature is kept at &#x2212;78 &#xB0;C by addition of dry ice and acetone as required.",
    "13] Continue stirring for 30 mins at &#x2212;78 &#xB0;C.",
    "14] Add saturated ammonium chloride solution \\(20 mL) slowly using a glass syringe and reusable 21 gauge needle.",
    "Remove the flask from the cooling bath and allow to warm to room temperature",
    "15] Transfer the reaction mixture to a 2 L separating funnel containing distilled water \\(150 mL) and diethyl ether \\(200 mL).",
    "Separate the layers and extract the aqueous layer with four 100 mL portions of diethyl ether.",
    "Wash the combined organic layers with 1 M hydrochloric acid \\(100 mL) followed by brine \\(100 mL).",
    "Dry the combined organic layers with magnesium sulfate \\(approx.",
    "5 g).",
