    "Step 1.  ",
    "Polymerize a PDMS layer in a glass-bottom dish.",
    "Using a serological pipette, pipette 1.8 mL of PDMS into each well of a 6-well glass bottom plate.  ",
    "Using a 1 mL pipette tip with the end cut off, add 200 \u00b5L curing agent to the PDMS in each well and mix thoroughly by swirling with a 1 mL pipette tip.  ",
    "2 mL total of PDMS reagents in the well will result in a 3 mm thick, 1.72 MPa stiffness PDMS layer after curing.",
    "OPTIONAL STEP:",
    "Place 6-well plate with PDMS into a vacuum desiccator for ~1 hr to remove air bubbles.",
    "CRITICAL STEP:",
    "Place PDMS in a 37\u00b0C incubator for \u226512 hr to allow for complete curing.",
    "TROUBLESHOOTING: If using single 35 mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes, you will have to experiment with the volumes needed \\(being careful to keep the ratio of PDMS to curing agent constant) to achieve a similar thickness of PDMS as described above for a 6-well plate.",
    "Step 2.  ",
    "Cut a small hole for insertion of cells and beads under the PDMS layer.",
    "Using a scalpel, remove a 1 cm x 1 cm square of cured PDMS from near one edge of the PDMS layer.",
    "CRITICAL STEP: Do not cut all the way to the edge, as the attachment of the PDMS layer to the plastic wall of the well is critical to holding the beads tightly in place against the coverslip.  ",
    "However, offsetting the hole from the center of the dish will allow a larger area for imaging confined cells.",
    "Step 3.  ",
    "Prepare tissue culture media containing BSA and coat PDMS and glass.",
    "Prepare DMEM containing 1X GlutaMAX, 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4 and 1% Bovine Serum Albumin \\(BSA) and sterile filter.",
    "Pipet 3 mL of media containing BSA on top of the PDMS.",
    "Coat the underside of the PDMS layer and the surface of glass coverslip.  ",
    "Spread media with BSA underneath the PDMA layer by applying a 1 mL pipette tip to the wall of cut edge of the PDMS and gently lifting the PDMS off the coverslip, allowing the solution to enter the space between, then gently removing the pipette tip and letting the PDMS set down \\(see figure 2, step 3).",
    "Incubate overnight in tissue culture incubator.",
    "OPTIONAL STEP:",
    "Different coatings including integrin ligands such as fibronectin or collagen alone or in different ratios with BSA could be used to alter the adhesivity of the PDMS and glass surfaces.",
    "Step 4.  ",
    "Remove BSA-containing media.",
    "Thoroughly vacuum off media containing BSA.",
    "Step 5.  ",
    "Prepare complete media containing cells and spacer beads.",
    "Mix recently trypsinized cells \\(250,000 to 1 million) with 2 \u00b5L beads \\(from a recently vortexed 10% slurry) in ~200 \u00b5L of complete media \\(DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1X GlutaMAX, 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic and 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4) and pipette into the square opening in PDMS.",
    "Step 6.  ",
    "Load cells and beads between PDMS and glass.",
    "Position cells and beads underneath the PDMS layer by applying a 1 mL pipette to the wall of the cut in the PDMS and gently lifting the PDMS off the coverslip, allowing the cell/bead solution to spread underneath the PDMS, and gently removing the pipette tip and letting the PDMS set down \\(Fig.",
    "2A).",
    "CRITICAL STEP:",
    "One bead per 50 \u00b5m2 should be visible by microscopy.",
    "OPTIONAL STEP:",
    "Confinement height for a given field of view may be confirmed by acquiring Z-stacks of a soluble fluorescent dye \\(e.g., rhodamine labeled dextran) that has been added to the media.",
    "OPTIONAL STEP:",
    "Bead density may be increased to add physical barriers and constrictions for cells to navigate around.",
    "TROUBLESHOOTING: If bead density is too high or too low, make sure that the beads are well vortexed just prior to adding to the media, and/or adjust the volume added to the media accordingly.  ",
    "If beads form aggregates, they may be sonicated briefly prior to adding them to the media.",
    "Step 7.  ",
    "Fill chamber with media and image.",
    "Add 3 mL of complete media on top of PDMS, beads and cells.",
    "CRITICAL STEP:  ",
    "Allow cells to recover from plating for 30 \u2013 60 min in a tissue culture incubator before beginning imaging."
