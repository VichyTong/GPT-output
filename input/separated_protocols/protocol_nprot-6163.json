    "Note that the total number of PCR wells from a single sample depends on the number of STAMPs collected in a DroNc-seq run from a given input of nuclei.",
    "A user may access the pool of STAMPs in different ways, depending on the number of nuclei they wish to retrieve and their sequencing setup.",
    "In particular, a user would typically access the pool of STAMPs once or more, each time taking only a portion of the STAMPs to generate a library, and repeat the process if more nuclei are desired.",
    "For our mouse and human brain samples, it was optimal to pool 20,000 STAMPs in each PCR reaction and then to pool 4 PCR wells together for the library preparation step.",
    "Depending on the amount of desired reads per nucleus and the sequencing yield, a user may pool a higher number of PCR wells in a single Nextera library, as we demonstrate here using 16-32 wells. ",
