    "Wash the sample a few more times with 10x RD imaging buffer, if the event rate remains low repeat step 20 onwards.",
    "Also consider that the 1x RD likely had a number of non-specific events occurring at locations where no docking strand was present.",
    "Therefore, rates will vary depending on the sample type, the location you are imaging and other possible mechanisms leading to non-specific events.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: We imagine most users will want to simply go straight to using the 10x RD strands, in which case one can add 0.5 \u00b5L of 100 \u00b5M 10x RD strand to the ~500 \u00b5L sample solution and gently mix immediately after Step 10 of the labelling procedure section above.",
    "Then simply remove the excess from solution with successive washes using 10x RD imaging buffer and enjoy the benefits of conducting DNA-PAINT with an order of magnitude lower imager concentration resulting in reduced background and fewer non-specific events.&nbsp;</p>"
