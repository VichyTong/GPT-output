    "These include:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain assessment: Patient is explained about the visual analogue scale (VAS).",
    "The patient is then asked to rate his pain by marking it on the 10cm scale (Annexure II).</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Range of motion ROM: Universal goniometer is used to assess the ranges of knee.</p><p>\u00d8&nbsp;Knee flexion ROM</p><p>\u00fc&nbsp;Patient position: Supine lying with knee in extension and hip in 0 degrees of extension, abduction and adduction.",

    "Similarly, he then takes stance on the affected leg and the unaffected leg is used for reaching out.",
    "The total reach distance is calculated for each leg by adding up the reach distance in each direction for that leg.",
    "A trial of 2 is taken, out of which the better result is considered and recorded.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the assessment is completed, intervention is given as follows:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultrasound: Patient is in supine lying with the affected knee exposed.",
    "The area of application is cleaned and the gel is applied over the area.",
    "The ultrasound is then applied for a period of 8 minutes with the intensity lying between 0.8-2.5w/cm<sup>2</sup>.The probe is continuously moved in circular direction.",
    "The method of application is therefore direct contact.",
