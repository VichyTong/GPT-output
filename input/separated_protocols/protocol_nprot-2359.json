    "Two protocols are presented.  ",
    "One protocol uses the Targefect-BAC reagent in combination iwht teh Peptide enhancer, an enhancer reagent that improves gene transfer by escorting genes to the mucleus.  ",
    "A major advantage of the Peptide enhancer protocl \\(see writeup below) is that it uses significantly less BAC DNA than the the second protoocl which uses Targefect-BAC in combination with the Virofect enhancer.  ",
