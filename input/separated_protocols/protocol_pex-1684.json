    "To prevent shadowing that may obscure visualization during surgery, use at least two sources of adjustable lighting to illuminate the operating field.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For convenience of transferring the animal once sedated, set the induction chamber next to the intubation station.",
    "For intubation, use a stand with an adjustable head positioning (Fig. 2b).",

    "STEP:",
    "The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals recommends using a recirculated heating pad under the animal during surgery to prevent hypothermia.",
    "However, because the metal pad interferes with the inductive power transfer for the devices, use an overhead heating source or exothermal pads instead.</p><p><strong>Induction of anesthesia (timing: 5 min)</strong></p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Induce general anesthesia using inhaled isoflurane vapors by placing the animal in an induction chapter with 3 to 4% of isoflurane (vol/vol) and an oxygen flow of 2 mL/min for several minutes until the rat becomes unconscious.",
    "Confirm loss of consciousness by gentle toe pinch.",
    "If movement is observed, wait until a deeper plane of anesthesia is achieved.",

    "Gently retract the rat\u2019s tongue with forceps to put the airway on slight tension.",
    "Blindly pass the 16-gauge cannula, supported by a blunt curved stylet, through the vocal cords and into the trachea.",
    "The operator should feel the tactile feedback of the stylet running against the tracheal rings to confirm that the endotracheal tube is in the trachea.",
    "Remove the stylet while holding the endotracheal tube in place.",
    "Confirm the proper placement of the endotracheal tube by checking the presence of condensation on a dental mirror (Fig. 3a).",
    "If at least three intubation attempts are unsuccessful, use an anterior neck cutdown to directly visualize the trachea.</p><p>10.&nbsp;Transfer the rat to the surgical workspace and connect the cannula to the ventilator (Fig. 3b).</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRITICAL STEP:",
    "For rats, set the ventilator to 80 breaths/minute on pressure control with a peak inspiratory pressure limit of 14 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. For mice, set the ventilator to volume mode with 180 breaths/min, a tidal volume of 180 L, peak inspiratory pressure between 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p><strong>Preparation for surgery (timing: 2 min)</strong></p><p>11.&nbsp;Place the animal in the right lateral decubitus position for left thoracotomy atrial implantation (Supplementary Video 1) or left lateral decubitus position for right thoracotomy for ventricular implantation (Supplementary Video 2).</p><p>12.&nbsp;Retract both forearms and secure them anteriorly and superiorly (Fig.",

    "For atrial or ventricular implantations, two or three intercostal spaces below the maximum pulsation point was identified for incision, respectively.</p><p>21.&nbsp;Make a curvilinear incision with surgical scissors over the chest approximately 2 cm below the left axilla (Fig. 4B, 5B).",
    "Carry the dissection through the skin and the muscle layer until the ribs and intercostal muscle are directly visualized.",
    "During dissection, stop any bleeding encountered by applying direct pressure over the area with either sterile cotton swabs or forceps.",
    "Alternatively, use electrocautery for hemostasis during subcutaneous dissection.</p><p>22.&nbsp;To enter the chest, gently dissect the intercostal muscle with Metzenbaum scissors while grasping and retracting the rib above with forceps to lift the chest wall away from the lung (Fig. 4C, 5C).",

    "Take care to not injure the lung upon entry with the Metzenbaum scissors.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRITICAL STEP: Dissect the intercostal muscle along the superior aspect of the ribs to minimize bleeding because the neurovascular bundles run along the inferior surfaces of the ribs.</p><p>23.&nbsp;Upon entry into the pleural space, carefully extend the incision through the intercostal muscle with Metzenbaum scissors to create a 2-3 cm opening along the desired intercostal space.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAUTION: Take care to not encroach onto the sternum so that the left and right internal thoracic arteries and veins are not injured.",
    "To avoid harming any other structures during this entry, gently push the lungs away, and point the tips of the Metzenbaum scissors up and away from the chest cavity.</p><p>24.&nbsp;Place a small animal rib spreader to retract the intercostal space open.",
    "Push the lungs down using a microspatula to avoid injury to the lung (Fig.",
