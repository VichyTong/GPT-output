    "**Sterilization of seeds TIMING 30 min**",
    "1 Place around 100 seeds into a sterile 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. ",
    "2 Add 50 ml of hypochlorite/H2O supplemented with Tween-20 while gently mixing and leave for 5 min.",
    "  ",
    "3 Discard hypochlorite/H2O and wash the seeds 4 times with excess \\(100 ml) of sterile water.  ",
    "4 Dry seeds on a sterilized paper towel for 5 min.",

    "5 Place the sterilized sugar beets seeds, 2 cm apart \\(around 10 seeds per plate), with forceps into plates containing solid germination medium.",
    "Seal the plates with parafilm and incubate for 7 days in growth chamber adjusted at 21-23 \u00baC. Seeds of good quality should give 90-100 % germination frequency. ",
