    "We focused on DNA methylation changes that persisted after AZA exposure of wildtype and mutant DNMT3A as these effects may determine the long-term consequences of AZA treatment in DNMT3A mutants.</p><p>For mouse LSK cells DNA input amount was limited, which is why we used the tagmentation-based whole genome bisulfite sequencing (TWGBS) that has been described previously<sup>1,2</sup>.",
