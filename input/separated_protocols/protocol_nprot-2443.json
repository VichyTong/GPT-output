    "The experimental procedure takes approximately 21 days.",
    "In case of using other mouse strains than wild type mice, the number of cells for injection and the time duration of the experiment needs to be tested and established first.",
    "Intranasal application of antibodies can be performed at different time points as well as in different dosages after tumour cell injection.",
    "The amount of antibody depends on the amount of protein you intend to neutralize in the lung.",
    "The data sheet of the antibody or previous publications might give a hint.",
    "As a possible control animals can be treated with PBS or the corresponding isotype antibody instead of the specific blocking antibody.",
    "We suggest the application of the antibody at two time points after tumour cell injection \\(Figure 1).",
    "To analyze the tumour growth, lung tissue can be embedded in paraffin cut into 4 micrometers thick sections which will be then stained with Hemtaoxilin/Eosin \\(H&E) in accordance to standardized histological laboratory protocols.",
    "Afterwards the tumour-bearing area can be analyzed.",
    "For this purpose, stained sections can be displayed on a computer monitor with a computer linked Nikon Coolscan V ED scanner using the Program SF launcher thereby determining the ratio of the area of the lung section occupied by tumour to the lung section tumour-free area.",
    "To classify the tumour type the affected areas the slide must be further analyzed with a light microscope \\(e.g.",
