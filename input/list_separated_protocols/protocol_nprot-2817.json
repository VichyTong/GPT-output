"\nThe measurement of the noise was taken between 08:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., which was during the period when testing took place. The baseline Leq noise measurements for the High Noise group at the noise exposed schools near the flight path in 2009  varied from 63.5 to 69.9 Leq. Maximum noise levels varied from 89.8 to 96.5dBA Lamax. In the case of the Low Noise group at schools in relatively quieter areas, noise measurements in 2009 yielded results of 54.4 to 55.3 Leq and 73.2-74.3 Lamax. Noise measurements in 2010 and 2011 when aircraft were gone produced results at the formerly noise exposed schools of 55.2 Leq and maximum noise levels of 60.8 to 71.2 Lamax. Levels at the quieter schools were averages of 50.5 to 57.9 Leq and 60.6 to 70.5."
