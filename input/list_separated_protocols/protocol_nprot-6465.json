The script assumes that the user has two FL microscopy images of standard solution \\(in our case sodium flouresceinate). The first image of standard solution is taken at the beginning of the microscopy session and the second at the end since the intensity of light source might be time dependent. The purpose of the standard is to normalize the intensity and for flat-field correction. Furthermore, the script assumes the sample images contain two channels, a DIC image showing all bacteria and FL image displaying only fluorescent bacteria. When the program asks you to select the sample image the Split channels option in the Bio-formats Import Options menu must be enabled. The script then makes an average fluoresceinate \\(or standard of your choice) image from two images taken at the beginning and at the end of the microscopy session and removes the local impurities \\(small dust particles, aggregates from fluoresceinate \\(standard) images). Afterwards, the DIC image of the sample is converted to a binary image and FL sample image gets normalized to fluorescein standard. The background from FL image is obtained and substracted. The normalized, background and flat-field corrected FL image is finally multiplied by the binary image obtained from DIC. As a result, all cells regardless of their fluorescence intensity are considered in the next step, in which the mean fluorescence intensity of each individual cell is obtained. The final results are saved as an excel spreadsheet, each line corresponding to one object \\(cell) in the microscopy image. The column mean corresponds to the mean fluorescent intensity of each cell. The corrected and extracted images are also saved to the chosen directory. Once the analysis is done the script asks you to click “OK” to continue. By pressing “OK”, all the windows get closed and the script starts again achieving a continuous analysis of several microscopy images."

Two contributions to fluorescence in GFP labeled strain, are the fluorescence of GFP itself and the fluorescence of other fluorochromes that are present in the same cells. To obtain the fluorescence distribution of only GFP, one cannot simply subtract the background fluorescence \\(autofluorescence) from the fluorescence of GFP strain. Instead, one can assume the two contributions are independent and in this case the distribution of fluorescence of the _eps-gfp_ cells is the convolution of distribution of GFP fluorescence and the distribution of background fluorescence \\(autoflourescence). To extract the parameters of unknown GFP fluorescence distribution fit the GFP distribution by convolution of background fluorescence \\(autofluorescence) and unknown lognormal GFP distribution.
