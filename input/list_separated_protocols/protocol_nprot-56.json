Pellet bacteria by spinning at 3,500 rpm for 5 minutes.  Discard supernatant and re-suspend in an equal volume of single peptone plus 100 µg/ml ampicllin plus 4 mM IPTG."

        "body": "For worm strains with a brood size similar to wild-type worms, approximately 10 L1 worms are added to each well of a 96-well plate.  For worm strains with a reduced brood size, more worms should be used per well such that the total brood per well is similar to that of wild-type worms – this allows easy comparison between wells and the robust identification of genetic interactions.  L1 stage worms are easily prepared by filtering mixed stage or starved populations of worms through a 10 µm mesh: wash worms off plates in M9 buffer and isolate L1s by centrifugation through a 10 µm mesh for 10 seconds at 1,000 rpm.  Alternatively, L1s can be prepared by bleaching gravid adults on the previous day and hatching worms overnight in M9 buffer.  L1 worms should be re-suspended at a concentration of approximately 10 L1 worms per 10 µl of M9 buffer."

To avoid settling of worms, the plastic tray should be agitated whilst pipetting.  For genetic interaction screens it is best to directly compare the RNAi phenotypes observed in a mutant strain with that seen in wild-type \\(N2) worms.  This can be achieved by alternating rows of wild-type and mutant worms in a 96-well plate, each row fed with the same bacterial clones \\(see Fig.",

        "body": "Worms are grown in a shaking incubator for 4 days at 20°C.  To avoid evaporation of liquid from wells, 96-well plates should be stacked in plastic containers within the incubator.  For temperature sensitive strains it may be necessary to use a lower or higher temperature and longer incubation time."

We score embryonic lethality \\(Emb phenotype) and sterility \\(Ste) semi-quantitatively on a scale from 0 \\(wild-type) to 3 \\(100% Emb or Ste).  To identify genetic interactions, an RNAi phenotype observed in a mutant worm strain is directly compared to both the RNAi phenotype observed in wild-type worms and to the phenotype of the mutant strain fed on a control bacterial strain.  Suitable control strains are those expressing a dsRNA that does not target any expressed sequence in __C. elegans__."
