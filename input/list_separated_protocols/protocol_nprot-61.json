        "body": "In each experimental session, 18 participants first received some preliminary verbal instructions as a group, where we informed them about the general experimental procedures. Moreover, the basic structure of the game was explained to the group, but the experimenter did not mention the different treatment conditions. Thus, subjects at this stage did not yet know that they would face players from different clan. This has the advantage that all participants received the same view of the game. We ensured that the participants did not communicate about the game before they participated in the experiment. Each participant received a show-up fee of K3 and drew a number at the beginning of the game. One at a time, in the order of the numbers drawn, the subjects then came into a separate room to participate in the experiment.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe game was then explained again to them individually in much detail after they entered the experiment room; this time the instruction include the information about their own role in the game and the group affiliation of the other two players. Since many of the participants had little or no education, the experimenter \\(H. Bernhard, who speaks Neo-Melanesian \\[Pidgin]) explained the experiment with coins and cups, representing the three players A, B, and C, before asking test questions. Participants who failed to understand the instructions were dismissed from the experiment but could keep their show-up fee. The subjects who answered the test questions correctly were then asked to make their decision. Subjects in the role of player A decided how much of their endowment of K10 they want to transfer to player B. Subjects in the role of player C decided whether to spend K0, K1 or K2 on the punishment of player A. Each K spent on punishment reduced A’s earnings by K3. \r\n\n\nWe elicited player C’s punishment decision with the strategy method. This means that player C indicated how much he is willing to spend on punishment for each of player A’s feasible transfers. Player C made this decision before he knew the dictator’s actual transfer level. The strategy method has the great advantage that we also collect information about punishment at transfer levels that player A did not actually choose, which considerably increases the statistical power of our results. Since we collected 11 punishment decisions from each player C – one punishment decision for each feasible transfer level – we always controlled for repeated measurement in the statistical analysis of punishment decisions. The strategy method has been widely and successfully applied in experimental games. In principle, it is possible that this method generates different results than the specific response method where individuals only respond to the specific actions the other players take. However, many studies indicate that the two methods generate qualitatively similar behaviours \\[1-4]. The strategy method might somewhat reduce the strength of punishment relative to the specific response method \\[2, 4] but several investigations also indicate that it has no effect \\[1, 3]. However, as we implemented the strategy method in all treatment conditions, the behavioral impact of this method, if there is any, would be kept constant across treatments.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nImmediately after they had made their decisions, we elicited every player A’s and every player C’s expectation about punishment for transfers of K0, K5 and K10 \\(e.g. for K0: _If Person A gives K0 to Person B and keeps K10 for himself, do you think most people in the position of Person C would pay money in order to punish Person A?_ When the subject answered with “yes” we asked: _How much?_).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe games were first conducted with the Ngenikas, then with the Wolimbkas. The Wolimbka participants were paid after everyone in the session had made their decision. After having played with the Wolimbkas, we returned to the Ngenikas and paid them their money according to the Wolimbkas' decisions. Thus the time lag between the game play and the payment was about ten days for the Ngenikas. They entered the classroom one by one for payment. We briefly explained which decisions had been made and paid the players their money \\(handed over in envelopes). Moreover, each Ngenika received K2 as a thank you for coming a second time."

Before we begin I want to make same general comments about what we are doing here today and explain the rules that we must follow. We will be making some experiments in which you can get some money. Whatever money you will get in the experiments will be yours to keep and take home. \\[Ngenika: you should all come again next week \\(date and time) to check if you got some money and collect the money.] Maybe you won’t get any money from the experiment, but today Assistant 1 will pass out K3 to each of you to thank you for coming today. This money is not part of the experiment, it is yours to keep. Assistant 1 and I will be supplying the money. But you should understand that this is not our own money. It is money given to us by a University in Switzerland to use for research. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBefore we proceed any further, let me stress something that is very important. You were invited here without understanding very much about what we are planning to do today. If at any time you find that this is something that you do not wish to participate in for any reason, you are of course free to leave whether we have started the experiment or not. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nI will now explain the experiment to you in the group and afterwards one after the other will come into the classroom with me and carry out the experiment. It is important that you listen as carefully as possible, because only people who understand the experiment will actually be able to participate. We will run through some examples here while we are all together. You cannot ask questions or talk while here in the group. This is very important. Please be sure that you obey this rule, because it is possible for one person to spoil the experiment for everyone. If one person talks about the experiment while sitting in the group, we will not be able to carry out the experiment today. Do not worry if you do not completely understand the experiment as we go through the examples here in the group. Each of you will have a chance to ask questions in private to be sure that you understand what you have to do."

Suppose Person A gives K5 to Person B, and keeps K5 for himself. Now Person C states that he would \"do nothing\" if Person A does this.

Person C states that he would \"do nothing\" if Person A does this. In this case, Person A goes home with K7 \\(He had kept K7 for himself and Person C didn’t punish him). Person B goes home with the K3 from Person A. And Person C goes home with K5.\r\n\n\n1.5. Here is another example. As before, Person A allocates K3 to Person B and keeps K7 for himself.

Person B goes home with the K3 from Person A. And Person C goes home with K4. \r\n\n\n1.6. Here is another example. Again, suppose Person A allocates K3 to Person B and keeps K7 for himself, but this time Person C states that he would pay K2 to subtract K6 from Person A. In this case, Person A goes home with K1 \\(He had kept K7 for himself minus the K6 equals K1). Person B goes home with the K3 from Person A. And Person C goes home with K3. \\(K5 minus K2 equals K3).\r\n\n\n1.7. And a last example: Suppose Person A gives K6 to Person B and keeps K4 for himself. Person C states that he would punish Person A for his decision and pay K1 to subtract K3 from Person A’s money. In this case, Person A goes home with K1 \\(He had kept K4 for himself minus the K3 equals K1). Person B goes home with the K6 from Person A.

This is the appropriate statistical tool because punishment is a discrete variable that can only take on three values: K0, K1 and K2. We control for repeated individual measurements and for individuals’ transfer levels in all regressions. Treatment effects were measured by dummy variables that take on a value of one if the observation comes from the treatment of interest. The dummy variable is otherwise zero. The impact of the different treatments on expected punishment at transfer levels of K0 was also examined with the help of dummy variables in ordered probit regressions. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAlthough p-values are a widely used method for reporting the statistical significance of variables, we also applied an alternative statistical approach to validate our inferences \\(as one of the referees suggested). We compared the Akaike information criterion \\(AIC) of different empirical models \\(probit regressions) to see which model fits our data best \\[6]. This approach has the advantage that it does not critically depend on the number of observations. When using p-values, even very small differences between treatments become significant if the number of observations is sufficiently large. This is not the case for AIC, which is defined as \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAIC =  -2\\(log-likelihood) + 2K,\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nwhere K is the number of estimated parameters included in the model \\(i.e. number of variables). The AIC validates the increased predictive power of included treatment dummies after adjusting for the number of parameters and makes it possible to select the model that best replicates the data. The model with the smallest AIC tends to make the best out-of-sample predictions. \r\n\n\nThe dictators’ transfer decisions were analyzed with tobit regressions \\(censored at zero) that take the fact that the transfer level is a function of the expected punishment and the treatment dummies of interest into account. These regressions also enable us to disentangle the voluntary component in average transfers from the forced component that is merely due to the threat of punishment. If we draw the regression line of the transfer level as a function of expected punishment, the intercept of the regression line with the vertical axis informs us about the average transfer level obtained if expected punishment is zero, which we term the voluntary transfer level. Deducting this voluntary transfer level from the average transfer level in a treatment yields the part of the total average transfer that is due to expected punishment. The estimated average transfer levels in the absence of a punishment threat can then be interpreted as a measure of voluntary norm compliance. It turned out that 57% of the average transfer can be attributed to voluntary norm compliance if A and B belong to the same group whereas only 20% of the average transfer was made voluntarily if A and B belong to different groups. This result confirms the prediction that there is a much stronger obligation to share if A and B belong to the same group."
