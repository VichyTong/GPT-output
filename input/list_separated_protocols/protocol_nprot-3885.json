            "An overview of the timeline and steps of the iNP reprogramming process is shown in Fig 1a.  In this protocol, the transcription factors SOX2 and PAX6 are transiently delivered into the cells by a non-viral method, using DNA plasmid transfection.  \r\n\n\nFor DNA transfection, the expression of the transgenes is driven by a CMV promoter and plasmid DNA is purified using the PureLink HiPure Filter Maxiprep kit from Life Technologies. pCMV-SPORT6 containing PAX6 cDNA was purchased from Life Technologies. SOX2 cDNA was purchased from Addgene and cloned into pEGFP-N1 \\(Clontech) after removal of eGFP expression cassette from pEGFP-N1.  The pEGFP-N1 construct is used as a transfection control to confirm transfection success. Alternatively, bicistronic plasmids that incorporate a fluorescent protein as well as the transgene SOX2 or PAX6 are used, and can demonstrate transfection efficiency. These are plasmids that have a lentiviral backbone and were constructed in-house using pLVX-IRES-zsGreen \\(Clontech) for SOX2 \\(Addgene) or pLVX-IRES-tdTomato \\(Clontech) for PAX6 \\(Life Technologies). Pairs of cistronic or bicistronic plasmids were utilized based on the experimental endpoint, with the bicistronic plasmids allowing for ease of monitoring and/or sorting based on transgene expression in live cells over the course of the experiment. Alternatively, the advantage of the cistronic plasmids is the ability to stain the cells with common fluorescent secondary antibodies such as Alexa Fluor 488 and 647 without interference from the zsGreen and tdTomato fluorescence, and these being safer constructs for downstream human applications.  \r\n\n\nPrimary adult human fibroblast cells are purchased from either Cell Applications Ltd or the Coriell Biorepository. Cells are proliferated and passaged in flasks until the required cell number is reached.  We do not recommend reprogramming cells that have been passaged to the point of having a greatly reduced proliferation rate. Cells are plated onto uncoated Nunclon plates at a density of 52,000 cells per cm2 \\(6-well plate format is a common choice).  After overnight attachment, cells are co-transfected with SOX2 and PAX6 plasmid DNA, using Lipofectamine LTX reagent \\(Life Technologies) for 5 hr or K2 reagent \\(Biontex Laboratories GmbH) overnight \\(Fig",

Media is changed three times per week, and after 30 days, cells are replated weekly and collected when iNP colony formation is optimal \\(see Figure 1b). Note that the number of cells is greatly reduced during this process, hence it is recommended that you transfect 6-10 times more fibroblasts than iNP cells required for downstream applications.\r\n\n\nThe iNP cells are characterized by analysis for the expression of various neural stem and precursor genes, and positional markers within the neuroectodermal tube such as OCT3/4, SOX1,  SOX2,  NANOG,  PAX6, BMI1,  HES1,  FOXG1,  SIX3,  GLI3,  NGN2,  EMX2, TBR2, DLX2, ASCL1, NCAM1, OLIG2 16 \\(Fig",
