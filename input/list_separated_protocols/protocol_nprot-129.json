        "body": "pH change of the medium during electrotaxis is inevitable when CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent media are used especially during a long experiment. To minimize this, two types of media are available as below, either one of them is desirable depending on the cell types to be studied: \\(A) CO<sub>2</sub>-independent medium \\(see REAGENT SETUP) or \\(B) special medium of choice with addition of 10 – 25 mM \\(final concentration) HEPES buffer.\r\n\n\n▲CRITICAL STEP For the majority of the cells we studied, CO<sub>2</sub>-independent medium gives the best stability of pH, usually up to 5 hours without changing medium in the system. If the time-lapse experiment is longer than 5 hours, it is important to exchange the medium in the electrotactic chamber no later than 5 hours after the experiment starts in order to stabilize the pH. Make sure to warm up the fresh medium before exchange old medium in the system. For special cell types which require special culture medium, for example keratinocytes which require KGM medium or stem cells which require special knockout medium with serum replacement, add 10 – 25 mM HEPES into the final medium immediately before experiment. Appropriate concentration of HEPES for each type of cells need to be tested by investigators prior to experiments.\r\n\n\n∎ PAUSE POINT The medium can be kept at 4 degree for up to a month."

If the cell cultures fail to maintain acceptable growth and viability over 3-5 passages during direct adaptation, the sequential adaptation method should be used.\r\n\n\n\\(B) For sequential adaptation, cells are initially inoculated into a 50:50 ratio \\(v/v) of CO<sub>2</sub> independent medium and the currently utilized medium.

Then build up four strips of 3140 silicon rubber blockers \\(barriers) at each side of the cover glass strips, leaving a gap of 10 mm at each end of the electrotactic chamber \\(see Fig. 1d). Make sure 3140 silicon runs to the edge of the Petri-dish side wall for a watertight sealing.\r\n\n\n▲CRITICAL STEP The gap between two cover glass strips must be no more than 10 mm to avoid leakage of cell culture medium. Allow minimum 24 hours for 3140 silicon to solidify completely.\r\n\n\n∎ PAUSE POINT The chambers can be stored at room temperature for a week.\r\n\n\n\\(B) This step is optional. Certain cell types require culture surface to be pre-coated with fibronectin, collagen, laminin or other substratum. Various pre-coated Petri-dishes are commercially available, which is convenient for experiments at lower magnification, in this case follow the instruction in section 4\\(A) above. For higher magnification experiments using oil objective lens, surface coating needs to be done on glass based Petri-dishes prior the experiments. Use glass-based dishes prepared in section 3, then follow the instruction in section 4\\(A). Investigators need to follow the manufacture’s instruction to pre-coat materials of interest.\r\n\n\n\\(C) Load the sterilized glass well on top of the electrotactic chamber in the dish prepared in section 4\\(A) or 4\\(B). Make sure the glass well matches the exact position of the electrotactic chamber on the dish \\(see Fig. 1e for the schematic drawing and Fig. 1f for the actual assembly).\r\n\n\n\\(D) Trypsinize cells to be studied and subculture cells into the glass well above the electrotactic chamber \\(see Fig. 1g). If using CO<sub>2</sub>-independent medium for EF experiments, investigators need to decide whether direct or sequential adaptation is required for the cells to be studied \\(see Preparation of cells above). Investigators will also need to decide the density of the cells to be subcultured into the electrotactic chambers. Transfer the chambers to 37 degree incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> supply. Wait 4 – 12 hours for cells to attach to the surface of the chamber. \r\n\n\n▲CRITICAL STEP To avoid drying up of the medium during subculture, the incubator used to keep the electrotactic chambers should be well humidified. The volume of the culture medium inside the glass well should be at least 1 ml for 22 x 10 mm chamber and 3 ml for 50 x 10 mm chamber.\r\n\n\n\\(E) Immediately before experiment, the glass well is gently washed with fresh medium for several times \\(either CO<sub>2</sub> independent medium or other special medium of choice). Pipette away most of the culture medium from the glass well, then take off the glass well from the electrotactic chamber \\(see Fig. 1h). The glass well can be washed and autoclaved for reuse. Glue a no.2 cover glass roof \\(either 22 x 22 mm, or 50 x 22 mm) with DC4 electric compound onto the 2 cover glass strips to cover the area of the subcultured cells \\(see Fig. 1h). This forms the electrotactic chamber. Add sufficient medium at both sides of the electrotactic chamber \\(see Fig. 1i). \r\n\n\n▲CRITICAL STEP When glueing the cover glass ‘roof’ onto the two side cover glass strips, push the cover slip roof down to minimize the depth of the chamber formed. This is important to maintain a stable voltage across the chamber as well as to reduce the Joule heating effect. Take extra care to avoid air bubbles entering the chamber.\r\n\n\n\\(F) Prepare a lid to cover the dish. Drill 2 holes on the Petri dish lid corresponding to the ends of the electrotactic chamber. Cover the dish with the lid, the cells are now ready for EF application. \\(see Fig. 1j).\r\n\n\n▲CRITICAL STEP When drilling the holes in the dish lid, make sure the diameter of holes is not  much larger  than the diameter of the glass bridges. This is to minimize evaporation of the medium during experiment."
