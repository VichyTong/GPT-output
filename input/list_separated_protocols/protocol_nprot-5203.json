        "title": "**Cautions before working with DMS:**",
        "body": "DMS is highly toxic and should only be used in a well-ventilated fume hood. We recommend using multiple layers of nitrile gloves such that the exterior layer can be removed and replaced after handling DMS directly. DMS should have a faint yellow color, that will grow darker due to oxidation over time. Open a fresh bottle of DMS every six months to ensure freshness and optimal reactivity. DMS will be quenched during the following procedure by BME and resulting liquid waste should be disposed of per your local hazardous waste regulations. With the exception of the centrifugation steps and final steps of total RNA extraction, all steps should be done in a fume hood.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\na. _S. cerevisiae_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n• Dilute saturated overnight yeast cultures to OD600 of ~0.09, and grow at 30°C to a final log phase OD600 of 0.5-0.7 at the time of DMS treatment.\r\n\n\n• Pre-chill a 30 ml stop solution on ice for > 1 hour before DMS treatment. Stop solution contains 15 ml 100% isoamyl alcohol, 9 ml BME, and 6 ml ddH2O. Also prepare and pre-chill a 10 ml wash solution containing 3 ml BME and 7 ml ddH2O. \\(Solutions will phase separate, invert to mix directly before using.)\r\n\n\n• Move 15 ml of log-phase yeast culture into a 50 ml conical and place in a rack submerged in a 30°C water bath, such that the entire 15 ml culture is just submerged.\r\n\n\n• Pipet 750 µl of DMS \\(5% v/v) into the yeast culture, stirring immediately stirring with a serological pipet. Treat the yeast for 4 min, with consistent stirring or swirling of the culture. Culture should remain submerged in the water bath during this time.\r\n\n\n• Pour ice cold 30 ml stop solution into yeast culture with DMS, cap, invert to mix, and place on ice. The DMS will be fully hydrolyzed by the BME at this point.\r\n\n\n• Centrifuge 50 ml conical for 4 min at 3,500 x g at 4°C. Optional: parafilm the lids to minimize the smell of DMS if centrifuge is located outside of a fume hood.\r\n\n\n• Decant supernatant into DMS/BME waste, will have a small pellet of yeast at the bottom. Pour in ice-cold wash solution, and shake/pipet to resuspend yeast pellet.\r\n\n\n• Parafilm lid \\(optional) and spin again for 4 min at 3,500 x g at 4°C.\r\n\n\n• Decant supernatant into waste. Residual wash solution remaining in tube is fine, and traces of remaining BME in tube will quench any remaining DMS released upon cell lysis.\r\n\n\n• Add 0.6 ml total RNA lysis buffer \\(6 mM EDTA, 45 mM NaOac pH 5.5) to tube and resuspend yeast pellet by pipet. Move sample to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube that contains 40 µl 20% SDS. \r\n\n\n• Prewarm 0.65 ml of acid phenol in thermomixer at 65°C. \r\n\n\n• Move tube with yeast/SDS mixture to 65°C thermomixer and shake at 1,400 rpm for 30 sec to ensure mixing of SDS.\r\n\n\n• Add yeast sample to tube with hot acid phenol. Incubate in thermomixer at 65°C, shaking for 2 min at 1,400 rpm. Note, that DMS-treated RNA can be brittle and high temperature or vortexing steps should be minimized to prevent fragmentation.\r\n\n\n• Immediately move samples into a dry ice / EtOH bath \\(<sub>1:1 composition) until frozen, </sub>3 min.\r\n\n\n• Spin tubes 3 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n• Add 0.65 ml acid phenol \\(room temperature) to aqueous phase. Incubate at room temperature in thermomixer for 2-3 min, shaking at 1400 rpm.\r\n\n\n• Spin tubes 3 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n• Add 0.65 ml RNase-free chloroform and vortex at room temperature in thermomixer for 30 sec. Spin tubes 2 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n• Add >1 volume isopropanol \\(ex. 700 µl) to final aqueous phase. Invert to mix well and chill >30min at -30°C.\r\n\n\n• Spin >45 min at 20,000 x g at 4°C to pellet nucleic acids.\r\n\n\n• Remove supernatant and wash pellet in 0.75 ml 70-80% EtOH.\r\n\n\n• Pulse spin tube to collect residual EtOH at the bottom, and remove all liquid with small pipet tip.\r\n\n\n• Air-dry 5 min and resuspend in 50 µl 10 mM Tris pH 7.0. May need to add additional volume if the pellet is large.\r\n\n\n• Nanodrop a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution of RNA sample. Procedure should yield >50-100 ug RNA.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nb. Adherent human cells\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n• Begin with a 15 cm2 plate of fully adherent HEK 293T cells in 15 ml media \\(other adherent cell lines will work with the procedure too). \r\n\n\n• Working a fume hood, remove 10 ml media from the plate into a 50 ml conical and add 200-300 µl DMS. Shake vigorously to ensure mixing.\r\n\n\n• Slowly pipette the DMS/media mixture back on the plate by tilting the plate and pipetting into a corner. Note that this step has to be done very carefully to avoid lifting cells from the plate. \r\n\n\n• Parafilm the plate, and move it to a 37°C incubator / hybridization oven for 5 min, keeping the plate in a fume hood if possible and swirling occasionally. Some cells may become detached during treatment.\r\n\n\n• Slowly pipet out the DMS/media into waste.\r\n\n\n• Add 10 ml of 30% v/v BME \\(diluted in 1 x PBS) and collect the cells into a 15 ml conical using a scraper to scrape the cells from the plate.  \r\n\n\n• Centrifuge cells at 1000 x g at 4°C for 3 min; decant the BME solution. \r\n\n\n• Wash the cells by adding 10 ml of 1 x PBS and repeating the centrifugation step. Decant the PBS. \r\n\n\n• Add 1 ml Trizol to plate, lysing cells, and extracting total RNA according to the Trizol protocol \\(Optional: if using higher amounts of DMS you may add 10 µl 100% BME to the Trizol)."
