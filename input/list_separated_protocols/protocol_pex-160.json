    "\n<p><strong>Organoid cultures prior to time course experiments</strong></p><p>Organoids are cultured in 50 µl/well of 1:1 Matrigel/culture maintenance medium mix within wells of 24 well-plates and in the presence of 500 µl of culture maintenance medium. Organoids are split mechanically every 5-7 days.</p><p><strong><em>﻿</em>Organoid time course experiment from single cells</strong></p><p><strong><em>Sample preparation and single cell seeding</em></strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>Remove the medium from the wells and collect Matrigel droplets containing organoids with ice cold PBS into a falcon tube (use 0.5 ml of PBS per well). Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 400 rcf and 4°C to pellet the organoids</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>Number of wells to collect depends on the type of experiment conducted (number of replicates and number of plates to prepare). For a normal time course experiment, we usually collect between 12 and 24 wells</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Discard supernatant and re-suspend pellet in Tryple (add 100 µl of Tryple with 10 µM of Rock inhibitor for each collected well)</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Incubate 20 min at 37°C with harsh pipetting every five minutes</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>AddDMEM/F-12 (~3 times the amount of used Tryple) and centrifugefor 5 min at 400 rcf and 4°C</p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>Discard supernatant and re-suspend in 0.5 ml of cold PBS (PBS plus 10 µM Rock inhibitor)</p><p><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong>Filter cell suspension through a 30 µm cell strainer directly into a FACS sorting tube</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>Keep samples on ice until sorting (ideally this should be done within 30 min)</p><p><strong>8. </strong>Prepare a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube with 200 µl of ENR medium (add 10 µM Rock inhibitor to ENR medium) to collect the sample (collection tube, store on ice)</p><p><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong>FACS sort single alive cells into prepared collection tube</p><p><strong>10.</strong>After sorting, centrifuge collection tube for 5 min at 800 rcf and 4°C</p><p><strong>11</strong>. Discard supernatant carefully, re-suspend in 1:1 ratio of ENR medium and Matrigel</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>Dilute pellet with a 1:1 ratio of ENR medium and Matrigel to obtain a final concentration of ~3000 cells/5 µl droplet. Depending on batch to batch variability of the medium compounds, organoid forming efficiency can show some variation. For this reason, adjustment of seeding densities might help (usually in a range between 2500 and 5000 cells/5 µl droplet). A final density of 100-200 organoid/well represents a good number for further analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>12. </strong>Seed 5 µl droplet of the prepared cell suspension for each well of a 96 well-plate</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>Number of plates and number of wells per plate to prepare depends on the experiment. Usually we prepare 6 plates with multiple wells containing organoids which we fix after 3h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h and 120h after plating</p><p><strong>13. </strong>Incubate the plate for 15-20 min at 37°Cin an incubator to let the droplets solidify.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>14. </strong>Add 100 µl/well of ENR medium supplemented with 20% Wnt3a-CM, 10µM of Rock inhibitor and 3µM of CHIR99021</p><p><strong>Remark:&nbsp;</strong>If FACS sorting is not possible, after step 6, count the cells and continue with step 10 to seed them. However, FACS sorting ensures that only single alive cells are in the starting population&nbsp;</p><p><strong>15a. </strong>For experiments without perturbations:</p><p><strong>1. </strong>After 24h replace medium with 100 µl of ENR medium with addition of 20% Wnt3a-CM and 10µM of Rock inhibitor</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>After 72h replace medium with 100 µl of ENR medium only</p><p><strong>15b. </strong>For experiments with perturbation by small compounds:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Depending of the experiment compounds can either by added directly after seeding or at later time points</p><p><em>Verteporfin treatment:</em></p><p><strong>1. </strong>Remove ENR medium</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Add 100 µl/well of 5 µM Verteporfin or DMSO diluted in ENR medium at time point of interest</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Change medium daily adding fresh compound and supplement as under&nbsp;<strong>15a&nbsp;</strong>until fixation</p><p><em>Inducible hYap1 overexpression:</em></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Remove ENR medium</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Add 100 µl/well of 0.05 µg/ml Doxycycline hyclate or ddH<sub>2</sub>O diluted in ENR medium at time point of interest</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Change medium daily adding fresh compound or ddH<sub>2</sub>0 and supplement as under&nbsp;<strong>15a&nbsp;</strong>until fixation</p><p><em>Inducible Lats1/2 double knock-out:</em></p><p><strong>1. </strong>24 h before single cell isolation culture organoids growing in a 24-well plate in 500 µl/well of 1 µg/ml 4-Hydroxytamoxifen or DMSO diluted in ENR medium</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Grow single cells in normal ENR medium as described in&nbsp;<strong>15a </strong>until fixation</p><p><em>DAPT treatment:</em></p><p><strong>1. </strong>Remove ENR medium</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Add 100 µl/well of 10 µM DAPT or DMSO in ENR medium at the time point of interest</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Change medium daily adding fresh compound and supplement as under&nbsp;<strong>15a&nbsp;</strong>until fixation</p><p><em>Ly411575 or MK-0752 treatment:</em></p><p><strong>1. </strong>Remove ENR medium</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Add 100 µl/well of 0.5 µM Ly411575 or MK-0752 or DMSO in ENR medium</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Change medium daily adding fresh compound and supplement as under&nbsp;<strong>15a&nbsp;</strong>until fixation</p><p><em>CHIR99021 or IWP-2 treatment:</em></p><p><strong>1. </strong>Remove ENR medium</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Add 100 µl/well of 5 µM CHIR99021 or 2 µM IWP-2 or respectively 5 and 2 µM DMSO diluted in ENR at time point of interest</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Change medium daily adding fresh compound and supplement as under&nbsp;<strong>15a&nbsp;</strong>until fixation</p><p><em>EREG treatment:</em></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Remove ENR medium</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Add 100 µl/well of 0.5 µg/ml EREG or PBS diluted in ENR at time point of interest</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Change medium daily adding fresh compound and supplement as under&nbsp;<strong>15a&nbsp;</strong>until fixation</p><p><strong><em>Fixation</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Spin the 96-well plate at 3000 rpm for 10 min in a pre-cooled centrifuge at 10°C prior to fixation</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Wash each well once with 100 µl of PBS before adding 100 µl of 4% PFA (diluted in in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Wash 3 x with PBS (100 µl/well)</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>After fixation, plates can be stored for weeks in the fridge (add 200 µl of PBS into each well).

Optional:&nbsp;</strong>If confocal z-stacks of organoids are acquired,&nbsp;optical penetration depth ofthe sample can be improved by optical clearing of the sample<sup>3</sup>. Each well is incubated in 100 µl of optical clearing solution at room temperature for 20 min (sample should become transparent). After incubation, the optical clearing solution is replaced with 100 µl of fresh optical clearing solution and the sample is imaged in optical clearing solution</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Optical clearing solution can lead to bleaching of the fluorescence signal over time.
