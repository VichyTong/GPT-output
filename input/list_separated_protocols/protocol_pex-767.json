    "\n<p><strong>Optimised protocol of QIAamp® DNA mini Kit for bacteria genomic DNA extraction from both pure and mixture sample</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This is a modified bacteria DNA extraction protocol subject to&nbsp;QIAamp® DNA mini Kit. The protocol is modified to do DNA extraction for both mixture sample and pure bacteria culture, especially for bacteria difficult to lyse.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pre-treatment of samples:</strong></p><p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure culture bacteria culture</strong>.</p><p><strong>This pre-treatment is suitable for gram positive bacteria or bacteria with stick cell wall and difficult to lysis. Frozen progress could also be used for gram negative bacteria to increasing the lysis effectivity.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>A1.</strong>&nbsp;Pick single and pure colony for broth culture. Collect 1ml of log phase culture in microtube.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A2.</strong>&nbsp;Pellet bacteria by centrifugation for 3min at 12000rpm. Resuspend pellet in clear water and centrifugated at the same speed for 2min. Remove the supernatant and put the bacteria pellet in liquid nitrogen or -80℃ fridge for at least 2h.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A3.</strong>&nbsp;Heat the pellet to 95 ℃ for 5min, vortex to the top speed and short spin to remove the drops on the cap.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A4.</strong>&nbsp;Put the pellet back into liquid nitrogen or -80℃ fridge until lysis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*:</strong>&nbsp;The log phase culture is active and easier to lyse, in order to obtain a better lysis effect, a smaller number of bacteria should be used if the bacteria are very difficult to lyse. The pellet can be collected during glycerol stock preparation, to make sure the bacteria is in the same status of glycerol stock. The frozen progress is the take advantage of the ice crystal formed in frozen temperature to break the cell wall and promoting the lysed effectivity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>B. Bacteria of liquid sample.</strong></p><p><strong>This pre-treatment protocol is suitable for the liquid base sample like real environmental water, pollution, drinks and also can use for powder sample dissolved in solutions and solid sample treated in buffer with stomacher.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>B1.&nbsp;</strong>Collect the bacteria from liquid sample with 0.45um filtration. Add equal volume of 0.85% saline to the filtration flask to wash the bacteria left on the flask wall.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>B2.</strong>&nbsp;Use a culture loop to swap down all the bacteria on the filter membrane and dissolve the bacteria in 1ml clear water and freeze the bacteria solution in liquid nitrogen or -80℃ fridge.</p><p><strong>B3.</strong>&nbsp;Boil the bacteria solution in 95℃ for 5min and put back to fridge before lysis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*:</strong>&nbsp;The filtration progress is mean to collect only the microorganism in the liquid samples; this is important for researches mainly focus on microorganism. As the metagenomic sequencing may collect lots of unwanted sequencing information if extract DNA from the whole sample without treatment. For the samples with big truck and particle, a pre-filtration can be used to remove the unwanted tissues. The filtration size could be modified based on the research requirement. A small volume sample up to 1ml can be used for extraction directly, no need the filtration step.</p><p><strong>DNA extraction with the Qiagen DNA mini kit</strong></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysozyme lysis.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pellet lysis.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>A1.</strong>&nbsp;Make lysozyme buffer according to the gram-positive protocol in Qiagen Handbook.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A2.</strong>&nbsp;Take pellet from -80℃, melt at room temperature. Use 180ul of lysozyme buffer to resuspend the pellet, lysis at 37℃, 1200rpm for 3h.&nbsp;</p><p>*: The lysis time could be further optimized based on the bacteria, as a longer lysis time may cause the degradation of DNA. However, insufficient lysis time would result in uncomplete lysis, which would highly influence the extraction effectivity.</p><p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microbiota solution lysis</strong></p><p><strong>B1.&nbsp;</strong>Dilute the following reagents in the microbiota solution to reach a final concentration as list in table",
