After focusing the sample with epifluorescence, set the confocal microscope to scan a square region of <sub>10 x 10µm2 with </sub>1mW power after the objective for 3-10 seconds. Switch back to epifluorescence mode, and note the position of the photobleached area within the camera image.\r\n  TIP: Alternatively, a fluorescent thin layer can be fabricated using a mix of fluorescein and transparent nail polish. Spread the mix on a cover glass using a razor blade to obtain a thin coating. After drying, the cover glass can be mounted on a microscope slide using aqueous mounting medium for long term use."
