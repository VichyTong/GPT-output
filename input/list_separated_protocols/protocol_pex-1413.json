"\n<p>Cell preparation:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HESCs are maintained as feeder-free in mTeSR™1 (STEMCELL Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before differentiation, adherent hESCs were rinsed with PBS and then incubated with Accutase for 6-8 min at 37°C. </p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissociated single cells were rinsed twice with DMEM/F12 and spun at 300g for 3 min. The resulting cells were re-suspended in mTeSR™1 which was supplied with 10μM Y27632 (Sigma-Aldrich), and seeded on 1:30 diluted Matrigel-coated dishes at a density of ~55,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. </p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the medium was exchanged for mTeSR™1 and maintained for one more day prior to differentiation initiation.</p><p><br></p><p>Stage 1: Definitive Endoderm (3 days). </p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After PBS rinse, undifferentiated hESCs (at ~90% confluence) were exposed to differentiation medium as following.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day1: MS12 medium supplied with, 3 µM chir99021, and 115 ng/ml Activin-A (ActA); </p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day2: MS12 medium with 0.3 µM chir99021, and 110 ng/ml ActA; </p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day3: MS12 medium with 100 ng/ml ActA. </p><p>Tip: (1) 90% confluence (at the moment for starting differentiation) is important as the cell density too low or too high can greatly reduce the final production of the β cells. (2) Some cell line may grow a little slowly, thus increasing the seeding cell quantity or extending the cell growth time will facilitate these cells to reach the appropriate confluence. (3) Handle the cells very gently at this stage as cells are sensitive and are prone to detach from the dish bottom especially at day2 and day3. </p><p><br></p><p>Stage 2: Primitive gut tube (3 days): </p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After PBS rinse, cells are exposed to MS12 medium with KGF (50ng/ml), B27 (100x), Vitamin C (Vc, 0.25mM) and dorsomorphin (0.75µM). Cells were fed with fresh medium daily. </p><p>Tip: Handle the cells very gently at the beginning of this stage, as cells are prone to detach from the dish bottom. </p><p><br></p><p>Stage 3: Posterior foregut (3 days): </p><p>10.&nbsp;After PBS rinse, cells are exposed to DMEM with B27 (100x), retinoic acid (RA, 2µM), Noggin (100ng/ml,), SANT1 (0.25µM), Vitamin C (Vc, 0.25mM), Pen/Strep (100x) and Glutamax (100x). Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day. </p><p>Tip: Note that RA is light sensitive. </p><p><br></p><p>Stage 4: Pancreatic progenitor (3-4 days): </p><p>11.&nbsp;After PBS rinse, cells are exposed to DMEM with B27 (100x), EGF (100 ng/ml) + Nicotinamide (NICO, 10 mM) + Noggin (100ng/ml) + Vc (0.25mM). Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day. </p><p><br></p><p>V-bottom plate based aggregation: </p><p>12.&nbsp;Stage-4 cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated with Accutase for 10-15 min at 37°C. </p><p>13.&nbsp;Dissociated single cells were rinsed twice with DMEM/F12 and spun at 300g for 3 min. </p><p>14.&nbsp;The resulting cells were re-suspended in aggregation medium (made of 5a-Medium supplied with 10μM Y27632). </p><p>15.&nbsp;Cell solution with 0.1-0.4 (according to experimental design) million cells was added into each well of V-bottom 96-well plate, followed by a spun at 300g for 3 min. </p><p>16.&nbsp;The plate was put into 37°C incubator for 8-12 hours for cluster formation. </p><p>Tip: &nbsp;If cells do not settle to the bottom of plate, centrifuge again by 500g for 3min. This step does not affect the cell viability. </p><p><br></p><p>Stage 5: Posing pancreatic progenitor for generation of β cells (4 days): </p><p>17.&nbsp;Pancreatic progenitor clusters assembled in V-bottom 96-well plate were collected and rinsed twice using DF12 medium, and loaded on 6-well air-liquid interface trans-well. </p><p>18.&nbsp;About 1.3ml stage-5 medium (which will enhance the propensity of pancreatic progenitor for generation of β cells) was added for each well. </p><p>19.&nbsp;Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day. </p><p>Tip: For transferring the clusters to the air-liquid interface, we use the wide bore 200ul pipette tips.</p><p><br></p><p>Stage 6: Endocrine progenitor (6 days). </p><p>20.&nbsp;Clusters were rinsed in DF12 and transferred to new trans-well. About 1.3ml Stage-6 medium was added for each well. </p><p>21.&nbsp;Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day. </p><p><br></p><p>Stage 7: Immature β cells (12days): </p><p>22.&nbsp;Clusters were rinsed in DF12 and transferred to new trans-well. </p><p>23.&nbsp;About 1.3ml Stage-7 medium was added for each well. </p><p>24.&nbsp;Cells are fed with fresh medium every other day. </p><p><br></p><p>Stage 8: Functional β cells (12 days): </p><p>25.&nbsp;Clusters were rinsed in DF12 and transferred to a new trans-well. </p><p>26.&nbsp;About 1.3ml Stage-8 medium was added for each well. </p><p>27.&nbsp;Cells were fed with fresh medium every other day.&nbsp;</p>"
