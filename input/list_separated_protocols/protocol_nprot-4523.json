Follow the protocol exactly, including a 55 °C overnight incubation step in Proteinase K for maximum yields. In the final steps of isolation, re-suspend DNA pellet in 100 μL of DNA Hydration Solution. Quantify once DNA is completely dissolved —this step can be enhanced by overnight incubation at room temperature or 4 °C.\r\n\n\n   b. Isolate genomic DNA from whole genome amplified single cells — Single cells can be isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting followed by whole genome amplification according to methods outlined in Leung _et al_.<sup>4</sup> and Wang, Y. _et al_.<sup>5</sup>. Genomic DNA obtained from these methods provides high-quality DNA in amounts amendable to the library preparation and sequencing methods described below.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<h5>2.
