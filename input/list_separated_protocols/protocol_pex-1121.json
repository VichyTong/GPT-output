However, the Hypersil GOLD C18 column allows an efficient VFA separation, except for butyric and iso-butyric acids. This condition may constitute a limitation of the Hypersil GOLD C18 column use for VFA determination. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid is significantly lower than that of butyric acid, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained.</p>"
