The pieces of music are, nevertheless, long so allow them to move onto the next piece at any point after a minute.  Beyond that, allow them to take as much or as little time \\(and repeat plays) as they need to make a decision that they are happy with.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING: This is the best time to ensure that the subjects can hear the music at a comfortable volume: not too quiet that they cannot hear, but not too loud that it is painful. It is helpful if ‘around-ear’ headphones are used because the experimenter should be able to faintly hear the music to confirm that it is playing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPAUSEPOINT: This can be done any time prior to the induction."

It is likely that the further this testing phase gets from the initial induction, the weaker the mood effect will be.  This decline can be mitigated to a certain extent by the negative music ‘boosters’ during rating scales, but post analysis of these scales can determine whether subjects were still feeling the effects of the induction."

Usually after about 1-1.5 hours following the induction, healthy subjects will not experience any residual effects."
