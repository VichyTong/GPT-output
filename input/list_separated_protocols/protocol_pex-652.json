"\n<p>The macro fungus, <em>Ganoderma</em> <em>lucidum </em>was made small pieces and dried at 50℃. The dried pieces of the mushroom were powdered and extracted with hot water for a week at 90℃. The hot water extract was then treated with ice cold ethanol in 1:3 ratio and kept at 4℃ for 48h (2). A precipitate is obtained at the bottom which is the crude glycan. The crude glycan is passed through DEAE cellulose column and eluted with deionised water. The elute is collected as 1 ml fractions. The fractions were pooled and precipitated with ice cold ethanol in 1:3 proportion and kept at 4℃ for 48h. The precipitate obtained is dried and treated with 3:1 ratio of Chloroform and methanol for the separation of protein in a separating funnel. The separated portion is collected and treated with 3 times ice cold ethanol and kept for precipitation. A small volume of the precipitate was tested with phenol sulphuric acid test to confirm the presence of carbohydrate. The precipitate is the Glycan, dried (a light brown powder) and stored. Structural confirmation was done by IR and NMR spectrum. The molecular mass was determined by gel filtration chromatography. Complete hydrolysis was done with trifluoroacetic acid for developing Paper chromatogram was done for monosaccharide detection. Structural elucidation was done by IR, NMR and Gel Filtration Chromatography.&nbsp;</p>"
