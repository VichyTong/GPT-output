Thus, we routinely extract proteins from 100 sheets punched out of the ablated porous membranes and analyze them in triplicate 2D gels. An average spot intensity of three gels is then calculated and spots are subjected to further analysis. Sitek et al. reported that 1000 cells were sufficient to generate a 2D image using our protocol <sup>24</sup>. Although the extracts from fewer membrane sheets could generate 2D images, the procedural protein loss is enhanced when the initial protein amount is decreased below a certain level. Although 100 sheets per three gels empirically generate a 2D image with an adequate number of protein spots, the amount of extracted protein can vary among cell types, and we recommend using more membranes if the number of protein spots detected on the 2D gel is less than expected."
