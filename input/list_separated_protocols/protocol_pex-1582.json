Add a silanized slide on top of the droplet slowly to prevent trapping bubbles</p><p>5. After loading, press gently on the slide to squeeze excess precursor from the gap and to ensure the micropillars on the SU-8 mold are in contact with the slide</p><p>6. Let chemical polymerization proceed for 15 minutes</p><p>7. Add 1-2 ml of PBS to rehydrate the edge of the slide and facilitate release of the slide from the SU-8 mold</p><p>8. Gently slide a razor blade underneath the slide and lift straight up to detach the gel slide from the SU-8 mold</p><p>9. Place the PAG slide in a 4-well rectangular slide plate filled with PBS before use.

Turn on water bath and set to 75 °C</p><p>2. Add 12 g of urea to separate 50 mL conical tubes for each separation assay to be performed.</p><p>3. Take out the gel lids in F-actin depolymerization buffer and remove 15.9 mL of buffer from the tube and add to the 12g urea conical tube to make 25 mL of 1X RIPA + 8M urea</p><p>4.
