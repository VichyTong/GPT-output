"\n<p><strong>Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) Colloid Synthesis</strong></p><p>1. 50 mL of 1 mM AgNO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution is heated at 200 °C to boilling.</p><p>2. 1 mL of 0.1 M trisodium citrate solution is fast added into the solution.</p><p>3. The mixture is kept boiling for 16 min under constant stirring at 500 rpm, then allowed to cool down to room temperature.</p><p>4. The resultant colloidal mixture is of yellow-gray color. Excess reducing agent is removed by washing the AgNP colloid three times with Milli-Q ultrapure water.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>APTES Modification of Silica Beads</strong></p><p>5. 1 mL silica bead stock (5.0% w/v) is dried overnight at 60 °C and dispersed in 1 mL anhydrous ethanol.</p><p>6. 1 mL ethanol solution containing 0.2% APTES is mixed with above silica beads ethanol suspension and allowed to react for 24 h at room temperature under continuous stirring at 200 rpm.</p><p>7. After reacting for 24 h, the solution is purified by centrifuging three times at 1500 RCF for 10min using anhydrous ethanol and discarding the supernatant.</p><p>8. The remaining pellet is further dried slowly at 60 °C before dispersing in 4 mL distilled water.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fabrication of AgNP coated Silica Beads</strong></p><p>9. AgNP coated silica beads are prepared in 1 mL by continuous agitation of AgNP colloids and adding APTES modified silica beads in a volume ratio of 997:3. This process is performed at room temperature under agitation at 100 rpm.</p>"
