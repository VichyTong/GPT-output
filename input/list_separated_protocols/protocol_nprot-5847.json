Setting up each superovulated female with a single male will increase the likelihood of fertilization.\r\n\n\no _Day 4 \\(morning)_\r\n\n\n Prepare microdrops with 50 uL M2 and 50 uL M2+0.3 mg/mL hyaluronidase in a 60 mm suspension culture dish and cover the dish with oil. Also prepare microdrop culture dishes of 50 uL KSOM media covered with oil. Keep microdrop plates at 37ºC until needed. \r\n\n\n Sacrifice plugged female mice, isolate each oviduct using spring scissors, collect the oviducts in a 60 mm suspension culture dish containing PBS, and place the oviducts into the M2+hyralonidase drop.\r\n\n\n With fine tweezers, rip the oviduct to release the zygotes and surrounding cumulus cells into the media.\r\n\n\n Using a mouth pipette, locate and transfer zygotes from the M2+hyralonidase to M2 media. Wash the zygotes 3 times in M2 media and then 3 times in KSOM media. Collect all zygotes in a clean drop of KSOM and place in a 37ºC 5%CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Do not disturb the embryos after they are placed in KSOM.\r\n\n\n• _Perform this step as quickly as possible. The quicker the zygotes are placed in KSOM at 37ºC 5%CO<sub>2</sub>, the more likely they will develop into blastocysts._\r\n\n\no →"

Using young females and optimizing the dosage of PMSG and/or HCG can increase the number of zygotes obtained. Scale the number of female mice superovulated in order to obtain the number of lines needed.\r\n\n\no →"
