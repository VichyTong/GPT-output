Comparisons of sex distribution between patient and control groups can be performed by use of the Chi-square test. Differences of mean age between the groups can be analyzed by use of an unpaired t test. Comparison of allele or genotype frequencies can be done using the CLUMP program \\(available at: \"http://www.mds.qmw.ac.uk/statgen/dcurtis/software\":http://www.mds.qmw.ac.uk/statgen/dcurtis/software). Genetic association for heterozygote and homozygote genotype with the SARS risk can be assessed by use of logistic regression using SPSS software \\(version 9.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and the odds ratio \\(OR) and 95% confidential interval \\(c.i.) can be calculated and adjusted for age and gender, where appropriate. An association can be considered significant at a P value of less than 0.05, and all statistical tests should be two-sided."
