Again, the blunter needle should be closest to the target egg chamber. It is not strictly necessary to remove all of the younger egg chambers, but we find that single egg chambers tend to lie better in the imaging chamber. Also some muscle sheath often remains on very young egg chambers, which causes the chain to move during imaging.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLearn how to distinguish the appropriate stages of egg chambers with dissecting microscope. Good markers are the relative size of oocyte compared to the whole the egg chamber, whether the oocyte has started to uptake yolk \\(becoming more opaque), and whether nurse cells are transparent or opaque,  \\(due to lipid droplet accumulation). We find that placing the dish on a black background helps, also illuminating the dish from above or the side makes stage discrimination easier."
