The SUVs suspension is mixed inside an eppendorf and frozen in liquid N2, followed by thawing on ice. The freeze-thaw process is repeated a maximum of the three times in the same eppendorf. Many well separated drops of 1 µl of the SUVs suspension is placed on the Pt-wires \\(inbuilt part of an electroformation chamber) and the chamber is placed inside a desiccator containing saturated NaCl solution with small vacuum sufficient to tight hold the chamber overnight \\(for max. 12 hrs.) in dark at 4oC. Later the individual partially dried samples are hydrated with the appropriate solvent at ~ 37oC and an a.c. electric field is applied to the Pt-wires. The temperature of the chamber is maintained at 37oC throughout the electroformation process. After the electroformation is completed, the temperature of the chamber is changed slowly to 23oC and fluorescence observations are made at the same temperature. The GUVs are shown in the Fig.",

        "body": "After about an hour, we select a quasi-spherical vesicle for taking 3D confocal stacks of the GUVs, at fixed confocal slice thickness and scan speed. Having all the 2D confocal stacks of a GUV from bottom to top, we align these with respect to each other to construct a 3D vesicle body, as described earlier in \\[19]. In some cases, we require to correct for the vesicle’s motion in the horizontal plane in order to align all the stacks on top of each other, for extracting a radius \\(r) and centroid \\(c) of the quasi-spherical vesicle. Individual vesicles are modelled as a sphere with a surface modelled by a triangulated mesh and each mesh-point resembling a volume pixel \\(voxel). We count the intensity values of the two fluorescence probes \\(NaP and RhdPE) in each voxel and project it onto the surface of the vesicle to map the areal-intensity counts of NaP and RhdPE. The area fraction of the fluorescence intensity of the two probes represents directly the area fraction of the two membrane phases and is well tested in \\[18] for a number of ternary lipid compositions.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFig. 1b shows the fluorescence intensity counts of the two dyes \\(corresponding to the two membrane phases) on the surface of a GUV. Using the intensity counts, we estimate the area fraction of the lo phase: A\\(lo)/A plotted in the Fig. 1c for a batch of vesicles prepared. As a control experiment, we have made an estimate of the lipid compositional state in the GUVs without NKA \\(Fig. 1d-f) in the lo-ld coexistence region. The A\\(lo) /A is <sub> 0.57 ± 3% \\(SEM, N=16)  for sample I and is </sub> 0.387 ± 1% \\(SEM, N=14) for sample II. The error bars include contributions from experimental and software analysis and constitute an upper bound on compositional variations. In order to compare the values of the area fraction of the lo phase in GUVs prepared by SUVs mixing and by conventional methods \\(dissolving lipids in chloroform), we have included the color diagram in the Fig. 2a, displaying A\\(lo)/A for a batch of vesicles prepared by the conventional method, which is taken from \\[18]. The two samples are indicated on top of the color diagram by black dots in order to highlight the measured A\\(lo)/A for these ternary compositions and the values closely match with shown in the Fig. 1 for the respective samples. We find the same area fraction as predicted by equilibrium thermodynamics in the GUVs with and without NKA and that it is not affected by the presence of protein in the non-active state with the SUVs fusion method. We have found that the macroscopic lo and the ld domains are visible in GUVs both with \\(Fig. 1a-c) and without \\(Fig. 1d-f) NKA. Both of the samples I and II are prepared by mixing SUVs of DPPC/chol \\(0.538/0.462) and DOPC with different mole fractions of DOPC SUVs and therefore, lie on the same line A1B1, as shown in the Fig. 2a. Moreover the sensitivity of the protocol is clearly indicated by the fact that by changing the moles of DOPC with respect to DPPC/chol, \\(as for the samples I and II) all the ternary lipid compositions in the coexistence region lying on the line A1B1 can be experimentally accessed without having to prepare new SUVs. The protocol could be generalized to work with three populations of SUVs \\(or more) to reach an overall composition \\(x1, x2, x3) in the coexistence region if the molar ratios of the populations are chosen appropriately, as described in \\[23].\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nC]"

A z-stack of the GUV of Fig. 3a is shown in Fig. 3c that confirms the presence of the domain structure.
