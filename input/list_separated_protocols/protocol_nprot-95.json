Differences in genetic background, age, and weight can affect the rate of inflammation and resolution and result in differences in cell types collected and scavenging capacity.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2│ Prepare chart to record animal number, weight, treatment, time of zymosan A injection, time of sacrifice, and volume of lavage fluid collected.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3│ Anesthetize mice with isoflurane in prepared chamber \\(beaker with kimwipes moderately soaked with anesthetic under piece of filter paper, covered with aluminum foil lid).

After the mice are sacrificed, test their reflexes by gently pinching their hands and feet with tweezers to make sure that they are dead. Place the mouse face-up on a Styrofoam surface and secure them by pinning down their hands and feet with needles.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7│ Incise a small bit of skin over the anterior abdominal wall using forceps and scissors \\(to see where to inject the skin i.p. and avoid puncturing a blood vessel).
