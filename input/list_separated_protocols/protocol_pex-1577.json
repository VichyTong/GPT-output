    "\n<p><strong>Methods </strong></p><p>The aim of the ZIKAction Paediatric Registry is to establish an international multi-centre registry of infants and children with documented ZIKV exposure in utero (i.e. born to mother with confirmed infection in pregnancy) and/or with confirmed or suspected congenital ZIKV infection to accomplish the following specific objectives: (a) to characterize the clinical, radiological, neurodevelopmental and laboratory features of included children; (b) to collect observational follow-up data to describe subsequent outcomes, longer-term sequelae and management in specific groups of children; and (c) to provide a platform for future studies, such as clinical trials and assessment of the role of host genetic factors in the susceptibility to ZIKV infection.</p><p>The classification of the ZIKAction Paediatric Registry is therefore a non-population-based, disease/exposure-specific registry that is physician-driven (43). The Registry is a component of the work package 2 (ZIKA-PED) of the ZIKAction project, with agreed participation from sites in Argentina, Brazil and Jamaica.</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Eligibility criteria</u></em>:</p><p>Children meeting at least one of the following criteria will be eligible for Registry entry:</p><p>- Were exposed to ZIKV in utero (i.e. mother received laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection during pregnancy through positive RT-PCR, IgM or IgG seroconversion) based on definitions and test availability over time.</p><p>- Have laboratory-confirmed congenital ZIKV infection (i.e. positive RT-PCR or IgM for ZIKV in any of the biological samples collected after birth), with or without CZS</p><p>- Meet the ZIKAction Paediatric Registry definition of suspected CZS without laboratory evidence of in-utero exposure or congenital infection AND who do not have a laboratory-confirmed congenital infection other than ZIKV or a genetic or other confirmed cause of microcephaly or other abnormalities listed in the case definition</p><p><br></p><p>A suspected CZS case was defined if any of the following was present: congenital or postnatal microcephaly, fetal brain disruption sequence, intracranial calcifications, malformations of cortical development (including simplified gyral pattern, polymicrogyria, and pachygyria), arthrogryposis or joint contractures. Microcephaly could be defined according to the Intergrowth 21<sup>st</sup> reference charts standards (44) and/or the WHO Child Growth Standards (45), with head circumference more than two standard deviations below the mean for age and sex classified as microcephaly. Fetal brain disruption sequence is defined as a variable combination of microcephaly, partial cranial bone collapse, cranio-facial disproportion, pronounced occipital prominence, very small fontanels, and redundant scalp skin. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Data collection </em></strong></p><p><em><u>Identification of cases for inclusion in the Registry</u></em></p><p>Each site has a research group composed of health professionals (paediatricians, other physicians and research nurses) that will identify children fulfilling the inclusion criteria for recruitment into the Registry. Processes will vary from site to site. in Jamaica, where a national ZIKV surveillance database will be used to identify eligible cases, the research group has applied for a waiver for informed consent for the inclusion of pseudonymised retrospective data. In some, the paediatrician will screen patients in their care to determine eligibility and then proceed with informed consent and registration if eligible. In other sites, eligible cases may be identified from pre-existing national databases of children with CZS. </p><p>Participant information sheets and informed consent forms for parents have been produced and translated for local use. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, informed consent procedures have been adapted to policies and measures of each country to avoid the spread of infection and take account of the reduced face-to-face interactions with patients and families. In this manner, for example, Brazilian and Argentinian researchers will obtain a signed consent form from the parents of eligible children using a combination of phone calls and courier delivery of documentation; </p><p><em><u>Data extraction and entry</u></em></p><p>The Registry collects relevant socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data using standardised case report forms (CRFs) via retrospective clinical case note review for mother and child at the time of registration. The information collected can be broadly grouped into the following: socio-demographics; maternal/obstetric history; pregnancy data (including details of ZIKV-compatible symptoms and laboratory results); delivery information and newborn assessment; and history of children's health that include clinical and radiological evaluations (physical, neurological, developmental, ophthalmological, audiological), and laboratory results that were conducted as part of their local standard of care. Wherever appropriate, harmonisation of data items with the ongoing ZIKAction prospective cohorts of pregnant women and their children has occurred, which in turn have been harmonised with other international ZIKV research consortia, to facilitate future meta-analyses (46).</p><p>Research groups at participating clinical sites will enter the information in a paper version of the standardised case report forms (CRF) written in a native language, and thereafter these data will be entered and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture: <a href=\"https://projectredcap.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://projectredcap.org/</a>) (47,",

Follow-up data from routine visits will be collected via chart review for children in the Registry.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, ethical and legal issues</em></strong></p><p>ZIKAction is funded by the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, and oversight of the ZIKAction Paediatric Registry is provided via the ZIKAction governance structures, with a Steering Committee which receives guidance from an International Advisory Board. The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that are consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and applicable legislation on non-intervention studies. Thereby, the study protocol was revised and approved by the corresponding health authorities and ethics boards in every research site. Local, national, and international rules on data protection will be followed and the General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 will be adhered to, as well as the relevant national laws and regulations.</p><p><strong><em>Data security and management </em></strong></p><p>Adequate measures to ensure data protection and confidentiality will be duly taken into account by all investigators. The Registry collects pseudonymised data only; patient identifiable information can only be linked to data included in the Registry by the study staff at each site with no identifying information transferred between sites or to the Registry database.</p><p>The Registry REDCap database is held on a secure, dedicated server maintained by the ZIKAction project coordinator (Penta Foundation). Access to the web-based database for data input and retrieval is restricted to research teams with appropriate authentication (personal log-in and password), following training and completion of a user responsibility agreement. </p><p>In addition to validation checks built into the Registry REDCap database, the quality of the data will be evaluated and improved by source data verification that will be the responsibility of each research group. Data quality checks will be performed centrally prior to any statistical analyses being undertaken, with liaison with participating sites to resolve any data queries. </p><p><strong><em>Use of Registry data and statistical analyses</em></strong></p><p>It is envisaged that a number of analyses will be conducted on data within the Registry. After the initial enrolment phase, the Registry data manager will produce a “snapshot” report of the data held in the Registry (e.g. numbers enrolled in different clinical categories) for circulation to all participating centres in order to provide context and high-level data to help determine what analyses can be conducted. Investigators are required to submit a concept sheet for any proposed analyses. Children eligible for inclusion in specific analyses will be identified by the Registry data management team. This team may also identify children meeting inclusion criteria for recruitment into external clinical studies, and return their Registry-specific study numbers to clinical teams who retain identifiers of the children and would follow local protocols regarding their invitation to take part in other studies. Participation of sites in specific analyses is optional; writing groups for each analysis/project will have representatives from all centres that have contributed data.</p><p>Statistical analyses are expected to include the assessment of child health outcomes associated with congenital ZIKV infection or exposure. Standard statistical methods will be used, as appropriate, in the analysis of different types of exposure and outcome data, including adjustment for confounding e.g. through multivariable modelling. Varying duration of follow-up and missing data items are to be expected; the analysis approach will depend on the research question and the amount and likely mechanisms of missing data. </p><p><br></p>"
