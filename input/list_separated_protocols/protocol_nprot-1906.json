        "body": "As  with any other manipulation of ES cells for the generation of chimeric  mice, previous training in general and dedicated ES cell culture  techniques is required. <strong>The materials/procedures described here  are the ones we routinely use for R1 ES cells</strong> and represent  general guidelines. However, as different ES cell lines may have  slightly different culture/handling procedures, is important that the  supplying laboratory provides the necessary information together with  the ES cells. For example, all the “knock-out first” alleles provided to  the research community by the <a href=\"http://www.knockoutmouse.org/\">International  Knockout Mouse Consortium; IKMC</a>) have been generated in mouse ES  cell lines derived from embryos with a C57BL/6N genetic background. We  advise to exactly follow the <a  href=\"http://www.eucomm.org/information/protocols/\">cell line-specific  protocols and culture conditions</a> provided by EUCOMM for these  ES-cell lines.</p><p>Independent of their origin, we recommend users to  verify the germ-line transmission potential of the parental ES cell-line  they plan to use for dRMCE or alternatively use ES cell-lines with  proven germ-line transmission. This is particularly important in the  case of conditional alleles generated by high-throughput approaches, as  the resulting ES-cell clones may not have been characterized in great  detail with respect to their germ-line transmission potential and/or  karyotype. If the necessary information is not available, we recommend  that minimally two independent parental ES cell lines carrying the  conditional allele for the locus of choice are characterized by Southern  blot analysis to verify correct targeting. In parallel, these parental  ES-cell lines should be karyotyped to exclude clones with apparent  chromosomal abnormalities.</p><p><strong>In case the germ-line  transmission potential is not known, we recommend the use of two  independent parental ES-cell lines for parallel manipulation by dRMCE.</strong></p><p>Detailed  protocols describing the PCR, Southern blotting and other molecular  techniques can be found in the appropriate molecular biology laboratory  manuals such as e.g. the Current Protocols in Molecular Biology series  \\(Ref."

            "</p><p><em>CRITICAL: treat ES cells gently and maintain  optimal growth conditions at all times by only using freshly prepared  media, minimizing handling times and taking utmost care during  trypsinizing and transfer of cells, etc. ES cells have to be cultured at  relatively high density and are typically split 1:3 to 1:6 every second  day onto a layer of mitotically-arrested feeder cells. Only during drug  selection after electroporation are ES cells grown without feeder cells  on gelatin-coated dishes. ES cells grow in dense colonies with very  defined borders and should never be grown to more than 70-80%  confluency; individual colonies should never touch each other. The  culture media have to be changed daily. When ES cells are split, is very  important to dissociate them well by gentle pipetting such that the  creation of air bubbles is avoided.  The quality of the single-cell  suspension has to be checked under the microscope. The generation of a  single cell suspension by gentle pipetting not only prevents ES cell  differentiation \\(and potential loss of pluripotency), but is important  for preparing cells for electroporation. Sterile conditions must be  assured at all times. For more details on ES cell culturing and  passaging, we refer the user to the laboratory manual “Manipulating the  mouse embryo” \\(Ref. 4).</em></p><p><strong>1.

Then the Mitomycin C medium \\(toxic) is removed and the plates with the  firmly adhered feeder cells are washed 3 times with D-PBS \\(with Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>).  Add feeder cell medium and return the plates to the incubator and/or  seed ES cells onto them. When using multi-well plates \\(after ES-cell  colony picking, see below), it is better to Mitomycin C treat the feeder  cells in 10-cm tissue culture plates, trypsinize and plate them into 48  well plates after washing. One confluent 10-cm dish of feeder cells is  sufficient to seed cells into all wells of one multi-well plate with 12  to 96 wells. Plates with confluent layers of Mitomycin C treated feeder  cells can be used up to maximally 3 days for seeding with ES cells. Just  prior to plating the ES cells, it is essential to change the feeder  cell medium to ES cell medium.</p><p>Step 1.1 \\(day 1): thaw one aliquot  of frozen parental ES cell \\(~3×10<sup>6</sup> cells/vial) into one 6-cm  dish of mitotically-arrested confluent feeder cells.</p><p>Thaw the vial  in a waterbath at 37°C and transfer the contents into a 15-ml tube  containing 10 ml of ES cell medium. Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes  and resuspend the pellet in 1ml ES cell medium and plate onto the 6-cm  dish containing already 3ml of ES cell medium.</p><p>Step 1.2 \\(day 2):  check the cells under the microscope and refresh the medium. </p><p>Step  1.3 \\(day 3): passage the cells from a 6-cm to a 10-cm dish.</p><p>Wash  the plate with 2 ml Trypsin-EDTA \\(1x, do not use any other type of  Trypsin – for details see reagent list). Replace with 1.5 ml of  Trypsin-EDTA \\(1x) and return to the incubator for 15 minutes at 37°C.  Tap the plate gently and pipette the ES cells up and down 5-7 times with  a 2 ml pipette. Check the single cell status under a microscope. Add 4  ml of ES cell medium and pipette 2-3 more times using a 5 ml pipette.  Return the dish to the incubator for 15 minutes. This will allow the  feeder cells to re-attach and allow transfer of the ES cells without  carrying over too many feeder cells. Transfer the ES cells by gently  swirling the dish and collecting the 4.5 ml ES cell medium into a 15-ml  tube. Centrifuge the cells \\(see step 1.1) and resuspend the pellet in  2ml of ES cell medium. Plate the harvested ES cells into one 10-cm dish  with mitotically-arrested feeder cells and 8 ml of ES cell medium. In  case the ES cell in the original 6-cm dish have grown almost to 80%  confluency, then it may be necessary to split the cells into two 10-cm  dishes \\(at 1:3 to 1:6 ratios).</p><p>Step 1.4 \\(day 4): monitor the cells  for potential confluency and colony morphology. Refresh the medium.</p><p>Step  1.5 \\(day 5): split the cells onto four to six 10-cm dishes with feeder  cells \\(at 1:4 to 1:6 ratios). For details see step 1.3, resuspend the  cells in 7ml ES cell medium for plating.</p><p>Step 1.6 \\(day 6): monitor  the cells and refresh the medium. The electroporation will be done the  next day.</p><p><strong>2. Electroporation.</strong><br>Typical  electroporation conditions for ES cells are 0.24 kV and 475 μF \\(high  capacitance) using the Biorad Gene Pulser II system. About 1.5×10<sup>7</sup>  cells in 0.8ml D-PBS are used per 0.4-cm cuvette. As rule of thumb, one  about 70% confluent 10-cm dish provides enough ES cells for one  cuvette. Grow always 1-2 additional dishes to ensure that sufficient  amounts of ES cells are available on the day of electroporation.</p><p>EXPERIMENTAL  DESIGN:<br>Experimental cuvette 1: ES cells \\(1.5×10<sup>7</sup>) +pDIRE  \\(50 μg), + replacement vector \\(50 μg). In general, a single cuvette is  enough per replacement construct when using dRMCE.</p><p>Control  cuvette: ES cells \\(1.5×10<sup>7</sup>) + pDIRE \\(50 μg). </p><p>Optional:  Control 2 \\(no DNA) and Control 3 \\(no electroporation). These controls  are in general not needed as they mainly serve to monitor the  performance of the electroporator or the quality of the media.</p><p>Step  2.1: trypsinize enough 10-cm dishes of approximately 70% confluent ES  cells \\(for details see step 1.3 and 1.5).</p><p><em>CRITICAL: assure  that ES cells form a single-cell suspension. If necessary, pipette them  further in the Trypsin-EDTA \\(1x) solution using a 2-ml pipette  \\(maximally 12 times in total).</em></p><p><em>TIP: prepare enough 10-cm  dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin during the trypsinization step. Cover  the surface of the tissue culture dishes with the gelatin solution,  incubate them for 5 minutes at room temperature and then aspirate the  solution. Leave the plates to dry in the hood for 10 minutes.</em></p><p>Step  2.2: Collect the ES cells after 10 min adherence to remove feeder cells  \\(as described in step 1.3).  Take great care not to transfer too many  feeder cells. Pool the ES cell suspensions from various dishes in 50-ml  tubes. Make sure the ES cell suspension is homogeneous and transfer a  100 μl aliquot into a 1.5-ml tube containing 0.9 ml of ES cell medium  \\(1/10 dilution). Count the cells and calculate the total amount of ES  cells in each 50 ml-tube.</p><p><em>TIP: take care to not let the cells  re-adhere for too long as otherwise a significant fraction of the ES  cells will be lost.</em></p><p>Step 2.3: Centrifuge the ES cells at 1000  rpm for 10 minutes. Resuspend the pellet in D-PBS \\(without Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-  this is crucial) at a final concentration of 1.875×10<sup>7</sup> cells  per ml, which corresponds to 1.5×10<sup>7</sup> cells in 0.8ml D-PBS.</p><p><em>TIP:  during the centrifugation step, open and label the cuvettes. Pipette  the appropriate amount of DNA into each cuvette. Prepare a bucket with  ice.</em><br>  <br>Step 2.4: add 0.8ml \\(1.5×10<sup>7</sup>) ES cell  suspension to each DNA-containing cuvette using a 1-ml cell culture  grade plastic pipette \\(this is important). Mix the solution by pipetting  up and down 2 to 3 times, which ensures homogenous dispersion of the  DNA. Prepare all the cuvettes first, then electroporate one after the  other.</p><p>Step 2.5: pulse each of the cuvettes and place them on ice  immediately after electroporation. Typical time constants range between  6.0 to 6.8 milliseconds, although this may vary depending on the  electroporator used. Following electroporation, let the cuvettes rest on  ice for 20 minutes.</p><p><em>TIP: during this time, add 10 ml of ES  cell medium \\(WITHOUT selective drug) to each of the gelatinized 10-cm  dishes. In addition, prepare one 15-ml Falcon tube with 10 ml fresh ES  cell media for each cuvette.</em><br>   <br>Step 2.6: transfer the  content of a single cuvette into a 15-ml Falcon tube containing 10 ml of  ES cell medium with a 1-ml plastic pipette. Rinse each cuvette twice  with 1 ml of ES cell medium to recover additional cells. Do not  centrifuge these tubes. Plate 2 ml aliquots of each experimental cuvette  \\(1:5 ratio) into three 10-cm dishes. For the control cuvette \\(pDIRE  only) plate two dishes \\(2 ml each). Place the dishes into the tissue  culture incubator.</p><p><strong>3. Recovery.</strong><br>After at least  24 hours, exchange the medium for fresh ES cell medium \\(WITHOUT  selective drug). This allows the ES cells to recover from the  electroporation and allows dRMCE-mediated replacement and expression of  the selective drug resistance gene. </p><p><em>TIP: as ES cells attach  directly to the gelatin, the medium has to be changed very gently. It  should be done the earliest after 24 hrs, i.e. during the  afternoon/evening of the day following electroporation.</em></p><p><strong>4.  Hygromycin/Puromycin drug selection.</strong><br>Step 4.1: two days  following electroporation, the medium in the experimental dishes \\(ES  cells electroporated with the pDIRE and the replacement vectors) is  exchanged for ES medium supplemented with the appropriate selective  drug. In addition, one of the control dishes \\(ES cells electroporated  with pDIRE only) also receives medium with the selective drug, while the  other receives regular ES cell medium. </p><p><em>CRITICAL: The control  plate receiving medium WITHOUT selective drug serves as important  positive control for ES cell growth and should be clearly labeled as  such.</em></p><p><em>TIP: As puromycin selection requires lower drug  concentrations, this is a rather low cost drug selection.</em></p><p>Step  4.2: Change the selection and control medium daily. The first clones  will become apparent after 7-8 days of selection.</p><p><em>CRITICAL:  during selection make sure to produce enough Mitomycin C treated feeder  cells for growing and expanding the ES clones. For isolation of ES cell  colonies, two 48 multi-well plates containing treated feeder cells per  dRMCE replacement experiment will be needed over a period of four days.  Over a 2 days interval, generate at least one 24-well, one 6-well and  one 10cm dish per ES cell colony that later needs to be expanded.</em></p><p>Step  4.3: The ES cells growing in the control dish without selective drug  will become sub-confluent usually in 2-3 days. Once this happens, wash  the plate three times with D-PBS and proceed to extraction of genomic  DNA \\(see part"

This is an important control as it indicates that the drug  selection is working.</p><p><strong>5. Isolation \\(picking) of ES cell  colonies.</strong><br>ES cell colonies are picked using a  stereo-microscope \\(cleaned carefully with ethanol) placed under the  tissue culture hood. In average, ES cell colonies are big enough for  picking starting at day 9-10 of drug selection. </p><p>Step 5.1: ES cell  colonies can be easily spotted by the naked eye through the bottom of  the tissue culture dish. Circle the colonies using a marker and  carefully screen them under the microscope for ES cell colonies with  round, defined borders, but where individual cells are not easily  distinguishable \\(Figure 2).</p><p><em>CRITICAL: Do not pick ES cell  colonies with a flat architecture and/or that are much larger than  average colonies. Due to the high number of ES cell colonies present and  the relatively low number of colonies that need to be picked, many  colonies with perfect morphology \\(see Figure 2 for examples) should be  readily apparent in the three plates selected per dRMCE construct.</em></p><p>Step  5.2: Add 40μl of cold Trypsin-EDTA \\(1x) per well into two rows of a 96  multi-well plate \\(24 wells in total; with U-shaped bottom). Keep the  plate on ice. Replace the medium in the dish with 8ml of D-PBS \\(with Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>).  An isolated ES cell colony is picked using a Gilson P20 pipette set to  10 μl by aspiration and transferring it into a well of the 96-well plate  on ice. After picking 24 ES cell colonies, incubate cells in the  Trypsin solution for 7 minutes at 37°C . Replace the D-PBS in the plate  that was used to pick the ES cell colonies with fresh medium containing  the selective drug and put the plate back in the tissue culture  incubator.</p><p>Step 5.3: after Trypsin digestion, add 175 μl of ES  cell medium without selection to each well using a multi-dispenser  pipette. Disperse the cells by pipetting them up and down gently a few  times with a Gilson P200 pipette set at 170 μl. Transfer the single cell  suspension to one well of a 48 multi-well plate with Mitomycin  C-treated feeder cells in 300 μl of ES cell medium WITHOUT selective  drug. Return the 48 multi-well plate to the incubator.</p><p><em>CRITICAL:  From now on, only use medium WITHOUT selective drug, as feeder cells  are not resistant.</em></p><p>Step 5.4: A similar number of ES cell  colonies should be picked the two following days by repeating steps  5.1-5.3.</p><p><em>TIP: In some cases, we have observed that fast  growing clones, which are first apparent, are negative for  dRMCE-mediated replacement. These clones probably arise as a consequence  of early, random-integration events resulting in rapid expression of  the drug resistance gene. We therefore recommend picking ES cell  colonies over a period of 2-3 days \\(i.e. about 15-20 clones each day).  In our experience, picking 40-60 cell colonies is in general sufficient  to yield several correctly replaced ES cell clones. Nevertheless, the  plates containing additional ES cell colonies should be kept and the ES  cell medium changed every second day until correctly replaced ES cell  clones are identified by PCR analysis \\(part 8).</em></p><p><strong>6.  Expansion of isolated ES cell colonies \\(48-well plate).</strong><br>The  day after isolation, inspect the cells under the microscope for  viability and density.  Exchange the medium by adding 500 μl of fresh ES  cell medium.</p><p><em>CRITICAL: To avoid cross-contamination between  wells, the tip of the pipette used to aspirate the old culture medium  has to be flamed after each aspiration.  The new medium should be added  to the side of the wells using a multi-dispenser pipette. Great care  should be taken to avoid touching the borders of the wells.</em></p><p><strong>7.  Passaging the ES cell colonies into a new 48 multi-well plate \\(2 days  after picking).</strong><br>Step 7.1: aspirate the ES cell medium and  wash the wells with 75 μl of Trypsin-EDTA \\(1x). Exchange the 75 μl  Trypsin-EDTA \\(1x, 75 μl) solution once and incubate the plate at 37°C  for 8-10 minutes. </p><p><em>TIP: if some clones have not grown enough,  they can be left in the original well for an additional day after  changing the medium. To avoid prolonged trypsinization, process only 4-6  wells at a time.</em></p><p>Step 7.2: during the incubation, remove  media from a new 48 multi-well plate with Mitomycin C-treated feeder  cells and replenish the well with 300 μl of ES cell medium.</p><p>Step  7.3: carefully tap the plate containing the ES cell colonies and gently  pipette up and down three times using a Gilson P200 pipette set at 60  μl. Immediately add 600 μl of ES cell medium using a multi-dispenser  pipette to inactivate the Trypsin. Gently pipette up and down four times  using a Gilson P1000 pipette set to 500 μl. Transfer 200 μl of ES cell  suspension into a single well of the new 48 multi-well plate and return  it to the incubator. Transfer the remaining ES cell suspension to a  1.5ml Eppendorf tube and proceed to DNA extraction \\(part 8).</p><p>Step  7.4: the following day, monitor the cells under the microscope and  change the medium \\(further expansion is described in part 9).</p><p><strong>8.  PCR screening to detect correct dRMCE-mediated replacement events \\(in  parallel with step 7).</strong><br>Step 8.1: Process the 1.5-ml tubes  containing ES cells for DNA extraction \\(step 7.3) in batches of 24  samples. Pellet the cells in a microcentrifuge; wash them once with  D-PBS and re-centrifuge. </p><p><em>CRITICAL: it is important to prepare  genomic DNA of good quality for reliable PCR identification of correct  replacement events. Therefore, the use of the protocol described here is  highly recommended. This protocol results in extraction of DNA suitable  for PCR analysis that is free of major contaminants.

Incubate for 2 hours at  55°C.</p><p>Step 8.3: spin briefly to concentrate the liquid at the  bottom of the 1.5-ml tube.  Add 350 μl of digestion buffer \\(without  Proteinase K) and 250 μl of 6M NaCl. Mix by inverting the tube several  times \\(do NOT vortex).</p><p>Step 8.4: centrifuge the tubes for 10  minutes at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Transfer the supernatant  \\(contains the genomic DNA) to a new 1.5-ml tube containing 500 μl of  isopropanol. Avoid transferring any of the precipitate \\(contains  proteins, etc). Mix by gentle inversion for two minutes and  re-centrifuge for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm.</p><p>Step 8.5: carefully  decant the supernatant – pay special attention to not loose the DNA  pellet. Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol and centrifuge for 2 minutes at 13’000  rpm. Remove the supernatant by careful decanting and assure that the DNA  pellet is not lost. Re-centrifuge the tubes and remove any residual  ethanol using a thin tip.</p><p>Step 8.6: air-dry the DNA pellets for 15  minutes and resuspend in 50-100 μl \\(depending on pellet size) of 10 mM  Tris-Cl, 100 μM EDTA \\(pH 8.0). Leave the solution for several hours to  overnight at 4°C to resuspend. Mix by brief vortexing and use 1-3 μl of  DNA solution per PCR reaction \\(in 50 μl total volume).</p><p>Step 8.7:  Use the previously designed and validated PCR strategy to identify ES  cell colonies with correct replacement events. The initial screen should  focus on detecting correct recombination at one end of the locus \\(i.e.  3’ recombination). To control DNA quality, a PCR amplification detecting  the wild-type locus should be included \\(all ES cell colonies are  heterozygous). ES cell colonies with correct 3’ replacement are then  re-screened for 5’ recombination. As a fraction of ES cell colonies  might be of mixed nature, it is crucial to verify the absence of the  deleted and conditional alleles \\(for more details see Osterwalder et al.  Ref."

Add an additional  3 ml of freezing media to the tube and aliquot the 5 ml of cell  suspension into the 5 cryotubes \\(1 ml each). Transfer the tubes to a  Styrofoam holder and wrap it with bubble-wrap.  Place this package at  -80°C. The next day transfer the cryotubes individually to into a cell  freezing box that fits into liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage.  ES cell clones frozen in this manner can be stored for indefinite time.</p><p><em>TIP:  One or several of these vials can be sent to the transgenic facility  and the ES cells defrosted and expanded for the production of chimeric  mice. One vial should be thawed into a 6-cm tissue culture dish  containing Mitomycin C-treated feeder cells.</em></p>"
