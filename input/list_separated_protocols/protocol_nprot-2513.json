    "\nPROCEDURE\r\n\n\nProtocol overview:\r\n\n\nThe protocol is divided in four steps: A. detergent screening for protein solubilization, B. protein purification, C. liposome reconstitution and D. autophosphorylation assay. In this protocol, we describe the purification and liposome reconstitution of FusK, the fucose-sensing HK of EHEC described by our group \\(5). Full length FusK, including sensory and the eight transmembrane domains, was amplified from EHEC 86-24 strain by PCR using Phusion \\(Finzymes), then cloned into pBADMycHisA using XhoI and HindIII restriction sites, generating the plasmid pARP10. This plasmid was subsequently transformed into TOP10 cells, generating the ARP03 strain \\(5).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA. FusK detergent screening for membrane solubilization.\r\n\n\nA small screening protocol for detergent solubilization was employed to optimize FusK purification, based on \\(4). This step takes about 3 days for completion.",
