    "\nNote\r\n\n\nIt is important to carefully check the integrity of the shRNA-pLKO DNA for each DNA preparation by restriction enzyme digestion. The reason is that the short hairpin sequence is easily removed from the plasmid by recombination during propagation in DH5alpha cells. Recombination may be avoided by using fresh antibiotics and a limited number of bacterial cell divisions. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 1\r\n\n\n- morning: plate Cos-7 cells in Cos-7 medium at ~40% confluency on 10 cm dishes. 1 dish per transfection. Make sure cells are distributed evenly over the plate.\r\n\n\n- Afternoon: transfect plated Cos-7 cells as follows:\r\n\n\n• Tube 1: Mix 300 ul DMEM low glucose \\(Lonza) with 24 μl Fugene 6 by flicking. Incubate 5 min at RT \r\n\n\n• Tube 2: Mix the following plasmids:\r\n\n\no 2 μg  pRSV-rev\r\n\n\no 2 μg  pMDLg/pRRE\r\n\n\no 2 μg  pMD2.G\r\n\n\no 2 μg  pLKO-short hairpin construct\r\n\n\n• add contents of Tube 1 to Tube 2, mix by flicking, incubate 20-30 min at RT. \r\n\n\n• Add mixture to Cos-7 cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 2\r\n\n\n- replace the medium of the transfected Cos-7 cells with 10 ml ES medium/10 cm dish. \r\n\n\n- Plate IB10 ES cells on gelatinized dishes at 4.4 x 10e4 cells/10 cm dish\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 3\r\n\n\n- collect viral supernatant from Cos-7 cells using a syringe and filter through 0.45 μm low protein binding filter \\(to remove cells). Add fresh ES medium to the Cos-7 cells. \r\n\n\n- Remove the medium from the IB10 cells\r\n\n\n- Supplement the viral supernatant with 8 μg /ml final concentration polybrene, mix, and add to the IB10 cells. 10 ml undiluted viral supernatant is used to infect 1 x 10 cm dish of IB10 cells. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 4\r\n\n\n- repeat the infection as described for day",
