At harvest, the cells should be at no more than 70-80% confluency.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: When cultures approach 100 % confluency, they tend to slow down general protein translation, and polysomes extracted from such cells show a shift from actively translating polysomes to a predominance of monosomes \\(a large 80S peak in the polysome profile). It is therefore important that the number of cells seeded are adjusted as necessary to avoid them reaching stationary phase."

Addition of cycloheximide “freezes” the ribosomes on the mRNA, preventing them from completing translation and falling off the RNA during the polysome extraction procedure. However, prolonged exposure to cycloheximide is toxic to the cells and should be avoided."
