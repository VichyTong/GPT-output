"\n<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p><strong>Tissue preparation (Timing 1-4 hours)</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut using a scalpel and weigh 30-50mg of frozen tissue per sample. Keep tissue on dry ice while cutting to minimize degradation. Transfer to a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube using a spatula and place back on dry ice. Clean scalpel and spatula with 70% ethanol between samples. Use a fresh weigh boat for each sample. Alternatively, this step could be replaced by cryosectioning a fresh frozen histology grade dissection of tissue and collecting several sections such that the total weight is between 30-50 mg. &nbsp;</p><p>CAUTION: Post-mortem human tissue can contain pathogens. Take precautions including wearing PPE and seek medical attention if the scalpel breaks your skin. </p><p><strong>Nuclei extraction (Timing 2-3 hours)</strong></p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer tissue using spatula to douncing tube on ice. Add 3mL of ice-cold lysis buffer and dounce with loose pestle 10 times and 5 more times with the tight pestle.</p><p>CRITICAL: Use proper douncing technique to ensure proper mechanical breakdown of tissue. Proceed slowly and avoid bubbles. Grind tissue against the bottom of the tube using the douncer with each stroke. &nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer homogenized tissue to a 15mL centrifuge tube by pouring and add 2 mL of chilled lysis buffer. Incubate on ice for 5 minutes gently swirling to mix 2 times during incubation.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 5 ml of chilled wash buffer to lysed tissue to quench lysis. Swirl to mix.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place 30 μm MACs SmartStrainer on a 15mL centrifuge tube. Pipette lysed tissue suspension on top of filter to remove cell debris and large clumps. In case of blocked flow through the filter, tap filter gently to encourage the suspension to flow through. </p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the precooled Allegra-14X centrifuge, spin down the lysed tissue suspensions at 500g for 5 minutes at 4°C.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decant supernatant into a waste beaker without disrupting the nuclei pellet.</p><p>CAUTION: The supernatant should be treated as biohazardous waste and treated with bleach before disposal. </p><p>CRITICAL: Pour out supernatant in a single motion as repeated pouring motions can dislodge the pellet. If the pellet dislodges during decanting slowly remove the supernatant using a pipette. </p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a 10 mL serological pipette add 10mL of nuclei wash buffer to the pelleted nuclei and gently pipet 8-10 times to mix. </p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat step 5-7 using the resuspended nuclei.</p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a 10 mL serological pipette add 5mL of nuclei wash buffer to the pelleted nuclei and gently pipet 8-10 times to mix.</p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat steps 6-7 using the resuspended nuclei. </p><p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a 1000 μL pipette tip, add 1mL of nuclei wash buffer to pelleted nuclei and gently pipet 8-10 times to mix.</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 1 mL of 50% working solution of Optiprep™ and mix well to make 2 mL of 25% iodixanol solution containing nuclei. </p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare Optiprep™ cushion of 2ml of 29% Optiprep™ solution in a 5ml Eppendorf centrifuge tube.</p><p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently add the 2ml nuclei suspension on top of the Optiprep™ cushion by pipetting slowly against the wall of the tube to avoid mixing. </p><p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the precooled Eppendorf centrifuge, spin the tubes containing nuclei layered over Optiprep™ cushion at 10,000g for 30 minutes at 4°C.</p><p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully pour out the supernatant leaving the least amount of volume in the tube without disrupting the pellet. <strong>?TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a 1000 μL pipette tip, resuspend the nuclei pellets in 500 μL or less of nuclei wash buffer. Gently pipette 8-10 times or until nuclei are resuspended. </p><p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a quick estimate of nuclei concentration, mix 10 μL of the nuclei suspension with 10 μL of Trypan blue in a separate tube. Load 10 μL of the mixture onto a Countess hemocytometer slide. Count nuclei on the Countess hemocytometer and measure range of sizes. For human neurons the average diameter of the nuclei should be around 10 μm. Trypan blue is a live dead stain and properly isolated nuclei should have be marked as dead cells. </p><p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the estimated count from the Countess dilute cells to around 500,000 cells/ mL or 500 cells/ μL by adding an appropriate volume of nuclei wash buffer. It may be possible to increase these concentrations for capturing more nuclei. </p><p>CRITICAL: If the concentration of nuclei is too high it can result in aggregation which will prevent efficient capture of single nuclei in subsequent steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add Hoechst stain to the resuspended nuclei at a 1:2000 dilution. </p><p><strong>Nuclei concentration assessment and capture (Timing 45 mins)</strong></p><p>Immediately prior to loading the Hoechst stained nuclei on the Chromium system, check to make sure the nuclei are well segregated (nuclei may clump) and recheck sample concentration using a fluorescent microscope like the Evos FL Auto (Thermofisher) </p><p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OPTIONAL: Use a 1mL pipette to take a minimum of 200 μL of the sample and filter it through a 40μm Flowmi pipette tip filter before counting and loading.&nbsp;This will get rid of the clumped nuclei and large debris that can clog the microfluidics of Chromium chips.</p><p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Load 10μL of sample onto a disposable hemocytometer slide and into the Evos.</p><p>CRITICAL: Make sure to pipette the full volume of the nuclei suspension several times before loading for accurate counts.</p><p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the Evos to 10X magnification and image the entire hemocytometer grid field of view in DAPI and bright field.&nbsp;This image makes counting nuclei easier and serves as a record as well (<strong>Fig. 3g</strong>).</p><p>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel to steps 22-24, make the RT Master Mix and<strong> </strong>aliquot appropriate volumes of master mix and water into PCR tubes according to the number of nuclei to be targeted for capture, referring to the Chromium protocol CG00052 Rev. D or later. <strong>?TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p>CRITICAL: The Chromium capture rate for nuclei from archived tissue is lower (~20% less) than the capture rate for cells. To account for this, it is necessary to adjust the count used to determine loading volume. We empirically determined that choosing the loading volume by using a count that is 30% less than observed count worked best for our samples. This adjustment may vary from tissue type to tissue type. For example, if the sample has a concentration of 500 nuclei/μL, the sample volume should be loaded as if it has 350 cells/μL (70% of 500 cells) in order to get the targeted nuclei to recover. </p><p>CRITICAL: Resuspend nuclei by pipette mixing the full volume several times immediately before loading to prevent aggregation of nuclei. </p><p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Load the Chromium Chip and harvest the nuclei captured in droplet (i.e. GEMs) according to the Chromium protocol CG00052 Rev. D</p><p><strong>Library preparation and sequencing (Timing )</strong></p><p>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse transcription, cDNA amplification, and library preparation are performed according to the Chromium protocol CG00052 Rev. D. Libraries can be sequenced on an Illumina sequencer. Sequencing two samples per lane of a HiSeq 4000 machine can yield ~100,000 reads per nucleus based on default CellRanger parameters and provide sufficient information for cell-type identification and differential expression analysis. Downstream analysis options for the sequencing results are described in Box 1.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Box 1: Downstream data analysis </strong></p><p><strong>Alignment, Demultiplexing, and Generation of Counts Matrix (Time: variable)</strong></p><p>Since our experiments utilized human nuclei, we built a pre-mRNA reference using the cellranger mkref (Cellranger version 2.0.1) command. Default parameters were used, starting with the refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-1.2.0 transcriptome and as per the instructions provided on the 10X Genomics website. For mouse tissue the corresponding pre-mRNA reference would need to be created for the mouse genome. We demultiplexed reads by sample index using the cellranger mkfastq command (Cellranger v2.1.0), aligned FASTQ files to the custom transcriptome, demultiplexed cell barcodes, counted the UMIs corresponding to genes using the cellranger count command and default parameters. These steps may be performed with custom code if desired. </p><p><strong>Custom Filtering to Recover Low Transcript Number Cell Types (Time: variable)</strong></p><p>While there are many options for software to be used for downstream analysis of snRNA-seq data such as scater<sup>33</sup>, SC3<sup>34</sup>, Monocle3<sup>35</sup>, etc., we used the Seurat R package (version 2.2.0, 2.3.0)<sup>36</sup>.&nbsp;Unfiltered gene barcode matrices for each sample were loaded into R using the Read10X function. At this step, cell names can be modified such that the subject name, batch, and biological condition are appended to them. Seurat objects were created corresponding to each sample using the CreateSeuratObject function with the imported unfiltered gene-barcode matrices provided as the raw data. Individual Seurat objects for each sample were combined sequentially using the MergeSeurat function. No filtering or normalization was performed up to this step. Since we were working with a single nucleus dataset, all mitochondrial genes that are transcribed from the mitochondrial genome were removed, along with genes not detected in any cell. More recently several methods have been developed to align multiple datasets of snRNA-seq and other single-cell level data<sup>28,37</sup> which can be used for combining the data from individual subjects if inter-individual variability or batch effects are deemed to have a large influence on the results. </p><p>For preliminary filtering, some nuclei with very low number of genes detected (&gt;110) and nuclei with very high numbers of UMIs detected (in the top 0.5%) were removed as low-quality nuclei and potential multiplets respectively. These cut-offs are arbitrary but can be based upon the distribution of the data. For example, in our dataset there was a sharp increase in the number of UMIs from 16,393 at the 99.5<sup>th</sup> percentile to 102,583 at the maximum which probably represents the multiplets in the dataset.&nbsp;</p><p>If the dataset contains multiple cell-types which are expected to be heterogenous in terms of the number of molecules of RNA present per nucleus (such as when the nuclei of different cell-types are known to be of very different size), the following approach can be used for removing low quality cells without unduly biasing the filtering against nuclei which biologically contain fewer molecules . For our dataset, given the known trend for higher number of RNA molecules in neuronal nuclei compared to glial nulcei<sup>10,11,38</sup>, the distribution of number of UMIs was fit with three normal distributions using the normalmixEM function from the mixtools<sup>39</sup> package. The rationale is that the filtered barcodes contain a population of low quality “noise” barcodes that have a very low numbers of UMIs on average, a population of non-neuronal cells that have an intermediate numbers of UMIs and a population of neuronal cells that have a high numbers of UMIs. After fitting&nbsp;the normal distributions, only the barcodes with a high probability (&gt; 0.95) of belonging to either the putative “non-neuronal” or putative “neuronal” distributions, and a low probability (&lt;0.05) of belonging to the “noise” distribution were retained for further analysis. As an example,&nbsp;in our publication, for a subset of 20 subjects, applying our custom filtering approximately doubled the total number of cells but increased the number of non-neuronal cells by almost 6 times<sup>20</sup>. </p>"
