    "\n<p><strong><u>4. RESEARCH METHODS</u></strong></p><p><strong>4.1 Study design</strong></p><p>We will conduct a population-based retrospective cohort study assembled using existing provincial birth registry data from the Better Outcomes Registry &amp; Network (BORN) Ontario BORN Information System (BIS) and the BORN-Niday perinatal database, covering all births in Ontario between April 2007 and March 2014. The study will be conducted through the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), which already houses the Niday perinatal database (2007-2012) and the BIS data from 2012-2014. We will utilize linkages between the BORN data and health administrative datasets held at ICES to provide additional exposure and outcome information around the time of birth, as well as provide up to ten years of follow-up for pediatric health outcomes for the children. For <strong>Secondary objective 2</strong>, data from Niday/BORN will be individually linked with neurodevelopmental data from the EDI. The population-level Ontario 2015 EDI data for children born in 2009 are now available at Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES).</p><p><strong>4.2 Study population</strong></p><p>From the BORN birth registry database, we will select all women who had a singleton pregnancy and delivered at a gestational age ≥ 20 weeks or birth weight ≥ 500 grams born in an Ontario hospital between April 2007 and March 2014.</p><p><strong>4.3 Data sources</strong></p><p>The databases required to carry out this study already exist within ICES. ICES along with members of our study team (which includes an ICES Scientist) have developed the capacity to conduct data linkage between Niday/BORN and other administrative datasets which will be used in this study.</p><p><u>4.3.1 Better Outcomes Registry &amp; Network (BORN) Ontario Birth Registry</u>: The BORN Ontario birth registry captures all hospital births <u>&gt;</u>500 grams or <u>&gt;</u>20 weeks’ gestation occurring in the province. The routine data collection includes information on maternal demographics and health behaviours, pre-existing health problems, obstetric complications and birth outcomes. Data are collected from medical records, clinical forms and patient interview when a woman is admitted to hospital to give birth. An ongoing program of data quality checks and formal training sessions assures a high level of data quality.<sup>17</sup></p><p><u>4.3.2 Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI-DAD)</u>: The CIHI-DAD is a service-based, national health care administrative database, administered by CIHI. Following each discharge from an acute care hospital, trained coders abstract relevant information from the medical chart using standardized methods and submit a hospital separation abstract to CIHI. Each abstract contains demographic information, medical diagnosis codes for the most responsible diagnosis and up to 24 additional diagnoses codes, up to 20 medical interventions received during the hospital admission, and other data elements. Medical diagnoses are coded using the Canadian implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10-CA) and medical interventions are coded using the Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI).<sup>35, 36</sup></p><p>4.3.3 <u>ICES Registered Persons Database</u>: ICES maintains a master registration file for all Ontario residence with a valid provincial health card. These files contain demographic data for anyone who has received an Ontario health card number and indicate the eligibility period for individuals to receive provincially-funded health care, accounting for deaths or migration out of province. This database contains the ICES Key Number (IKN), an encrypted identification variable to enable linkage between administrative databases at ICES. Registration files will be used to determine the follow-up period for children and for linkage between datasets.</p><p>4.3.4 <u>Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) Claims Database</u>: ICES maintains a database for all physician claims reimbursed by the Ontario Ministry of Health. This database records the underlying reason for physician visit on each claim using and ICD diagnostic codes and OHIP fee service codes are applied for diagnostic and clinical consultation services. This database will be used for ascertainment of childhood outcomes using validated diagnostic codes and case-finding algorithms for determining outcomes.</p><p>4.3.5 <u>Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) National Ambulatory Care Reporting System</u>: The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System is also a national database administered by CIHI, with annual transfer of Ontario records to ICES. NACRS captures data originating from urgent visit to emergency departments in Ontario and contains up to 10 clinical diagnoses on each abstract using the ICD-10-CA classification.</p><p><u>4.3.6 Early Development Instrument (EDI) for Secondary Objective 2</u></p><p>Early development from birth to age five represents a critical time to shape future productivity.<sup>37</sup> Indicators of child development at this age have been shown to be predictive of both school performance and later life economic potential and human capital.<sup>38, 39</sup> The EDI is a validated measure of child development used in Canada and several countries internationally and has been demonstrated to be robust marker of child development and future school performance.<sup>40</sup> It is a 103-item teacher-completed assessment of children in kindergarten who will be entering primary school (conducted at 5 to 6 years of age). It captures a teachers’ view of the development and achievement skills of the children in their classroom using questions about noticeable markers of brain development for this age.<sup>41</sup> We will examine the domain scores for “language and cognitive development”, which has been identified as the strongest predictor of later school performance.<sup>19, 42-45</sup> The EDI is administered by the Offord Centre for Child Studies at McMaster University and data collection has been undertaken in all publically funded Ontario schools in multiple cycles from 2004 and 2015.<sup>46</sup> Data for the 2015 cycle, covering children born in 2009 are now available at ICES and our team has successfully completed linkages to other health data sources using identifiers for date of birth, sex, and postal code.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4.4 Database linkages and access</strong></p><p>The methodology to link the BORN-Niday perinatal data (2007-2012) with administrative databases at ICES has been successfully developed in a previous study led by members of our Research Team<sup>47</sup> and the linked files and methodologies are available for this current project. The record linkage of the BIS data from 2012-2014 will be carried out by an ICES analyst.&nbsp;The linked study files will be developed and used in accordance with provincial privacy legislation to ensure that linked database files are de-identified, stored, accessed and analyzed within a secure network environment.</p><p><strong>4.5 Exposure variables</strong></p><p>Prenatal exposure to cannabis will be measured by physician documentation, which is collected in BORN during antenatal and/or intrapartum visits. Maternal drugs and substance exposures are likely to be underreported in BORN and therefore two additional approaches will be carried out to increase the sensitivity to identify women who have used cannabis in pregnancy. A chart and medical record review will be carried out on a random sample of patients at The Ottawa Hospital who did and did not report use of cannabis to determine the sensitivity and specificity of self-reporting in BORN. The methodology for the validation study will be detailed in a supplemental protocol. In addition, we will search for relevant maternal (ICD-10 codes F12 and subcodes for cannabis) and stillbirth/newborn diagnostic codes (ICD-10 codes P04.4 and P96.1 for neonatal withdrawal syndrome and concomitant use of cannabinoids) in the CIHI-DAD to identify additional exposed mothers and we will conduct a review of a sample of these records to determine accuracy. Analyses of BORN data from 2012-13 and 2013-14 indicated that the self-reported prevalence of prenatal cannabis use was approximately 1.5-2%.<sup>48</sup></p><p><br></p><p><strong>4.6 Outcome variables</strong></p><p>\tStudy outcomes will be ascertained from the linked database which contains information on child outcomes including standard diagnostic codes to document primary diagnoses.</p><p>\t<strong>Primary Objective</strong>: The <u>primary outcome</u> of the study will be child autism spectrum disorder diagnosed after age",

        "body": "Autism spectrum disorder is defined as at least 2 outpatient diagnoses by either a pediatrician or psychiatrist or at least 1 diagnosis in hospital databases after the age of 2 years, or both. This definition has been used previously in studies conducted by ICES,<sup>49</sup> and had a positive predictive value of 87% when used in US insurance data.<sup>50</sup> Follow-up will be to maximum age of 10 years and median age of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis is approximately 4.6 years.<sup>51</sup></p><p>\t<u>Secondary outcomes</u> will include intellectual disability and learning disorders; and emotional and behavioural disorders with onset occurring in childhood<sup>52</sup> including: attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders, depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant and conduct disorders. <strong> </strong></p><p>\t<strong>Secondary Objective 1</strong>: <u>Rates of health service utilization</u> for pediatric mental health is an important indicator<sup>53</sup> but limited data exist in the cannabis-exposed population. Utilization of health services in children will be measured as rates of primary care visits (including family physicians and pediatricians), visits to psychiatrists, emergency department visits, walk-in clinics or other urgent care centres, and in-patient hospitalizations to identify diagnoses with the highest frequency and associated costs.<sup>54, 55</sup> Visits will be converted to costs from the time of prenatal care through the first 10 years of life for exposed and unexposed infants.</p><p>\t<strong>Secondary Objective 2</strong>: <u>Childhood neurodevelopment assessed in the EDI.</u> Cannabis exposure in pregnancy will be related to binary outcomes for scores falling below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile on the <u>language and cognitive development domain</u> and <u>emotional maturity</u> subdomains for <u>attention/hyperactive</u>, <u>anxious</u>, and <u>aggressive behaviour</u> of the EDI. Secondary analyses will also analyze the continuous EDI scores</p><p><strong>4.7 Confounding variables</strong></p><p>\tBased on the literature and our previous work on perinatal use of tobacco, electronic cigarettes, and other substances,<sup>26, 56-59</sup> we have identified a number of health, behavioural, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics potentially associated with cannabis use and study outcomes.<sup>60</sup> These factors include maternal age, comorbid health conditions (including pre-eclampsia<sup>61</sup>) and psychiatric disorders, previous history of trauma, income, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, parity, relationship status, geographic identifiers (health region, urban/rural location, census geographic information obtained from postal codes), antenatal care provider, marital status, season of conception<sup>62</sup>, historical use of health services, familial diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders, and use of other substances during pregnancy.</p><p>\tWe will use high-dimensional propensity score methods (HDPS) as an approach to account for confounding arising from the identified covariates and as a proxy for unobserved confounders.<sup>63</sup> An ICES-developed HDPS algorithm will incorporate multiple surrogate variables including diagnostic and procedure codes, billing codes and drug claims available from ICES-linked databases to represent the unobserved confounding structure.<sup>64</sup> Alternate approaches will explore and assess the possibility of confounding and bias in the exposure-outcome relationship dataset including negative control<sup>65</sup> analyses using different outcomes and exposures. For example, examining the use of prenatal folic acid as an exposure which is not causally related to preterm birth<sup>66</sup> or outcomes but that is within the study dataset could be used to assess the confounding structure and robustness of the cannabis-outcome associations.</p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong><u>5. STATISTICAL ANALYSES AND STUDY POWER</u></strong></p><p><strong>5.1 Statistical analyses</strong></p><p>\tDescriptive analyses will be conducted to compare mothers who used cannabis during pregnancy and those who did not across maternal demographic and socioeconomic characteristics using means, medians, and frequencies and corresponding statistical tests (t-tests, chi-squared tests) and standardized differences to with absolute differences of >10% considered indicative of a meaningful difference.</p><p>\tTo test for associations between cannabis use in pregnancy and childhood outcomes, for each outcome we will compare women who used cannabis to those who did not. We will utilize HDPS methods to account for the potential effects of unmeasured confounding on the cannabis-outcome relationship. An available HDPS algorithm will be implemented to select a large set of target covariates from the linked databases and data dimensions will be identified from diagnostic coding systems.<sup>63</sup> A temporal window of 12 months prior to delivery will be specified and within each dimension the most prevalent codes will be rank ordered and top <em>n</em> most prevalent codes will be selected and converted into a numeric score based on recurrence.<sup>63</sup> Covariates will then be prioritized and selected based on exposure-confounder and confounder-outcome associations. The probability of exposure will be calculated for each covariate and a certain number (up to n=500 covariates) will be used for HDPS estimation. Other prespecified confounders deemed to be important, a priori, including maternal age, baby sex, income, use of cigarettes, alcohol or other drugs will be retained as part of the final propensity score (PS). Following estimation of the PS, inverse probability of treatment weighting<sup>67</sup> will be implemented and balance assessed among measured covariates between the exposed and unexposed groups.</p><p>\tOnce the data have achieved covariate balance, we will use log-binomial regression to assess the association between prenatal cannabis exposure and autism spectrum disorder and secondary outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to allow for censoring and proportional hazards assumptions in models will be assessed using log-log survival curves and residual plots. Rates of urgent and in-patient health service utilization will be modeled using Poisson regression.</p><p><strong>5.2 Study power</strong></p><p>\tData will come from the linked BORN-ICES dataset with a fixed sample size. For the primary outcome, autism spectrum disorder, assuming a rate of 5% in the study population, we will have 90% power based on a chi-squared test to detect a relative risk of 1.25 for the cannabis-autism association assuming a 1% prevalence of prenatal cannabis use. Therefore, the study will be sufficiently powered and we have prespecified the magnitude of clinically important effects to be 1.5 or higher.</p><p>\tFor <strong>Secondary Objective 2</strong>, EDI data are available on approximately 125,000 children aged"

For continuous analyses of EDI domain scores, we will have >90% power to detect less than a 0.25 difference in mean scores between exposed and unexposed groups for EDI domains, with a difference of this magnitude considered meaningful.<sup>19</sup></p>"
