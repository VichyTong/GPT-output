Extra motifs \\(e.g. for regulation) can be introduced to this component, and if designed correctly, should behave as intended. It is also possible with this synthesis technique to create an entirely new hybrid component by linking together several characterized motifs in a rational design.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor the design, the core sequences of essential motifs are specified and the base sequences between these are unspecified \\(i.e. defined as ‘N’). It is recommended that the precise nucleotide distance between motifs is maintained; otherwise their function can be lost. More ‘N’ sequence in the design \\(including some within motifs) ensures more variation in the final component library but will require more screening as a higher percentage of components risk being non-functional.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nExample 1: _E. coli_ LacXYZ promoter\r\n\n\n        -35          -10       +1  _Olac_\r\n\n\ncacccca"
