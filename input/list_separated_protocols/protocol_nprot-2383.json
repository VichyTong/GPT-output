We routinely use the CTAB<sup>37</sup> method for marine mollusks muscle, and the CCDB<sup>38</sup> method for the fish. \r\n\n\nΔ CRITICAL STEP Any other kits/standard methods of DNA extraction could alternatively be used \\(see Experimental design). Nevertheless, when samples have to be compared with each other or with a control, all of them should be extracted using the same extraction method."
