Suck the postsynaptic neuronal cell body into the pipette by applying a strong suction to the pipette, and pull away the pipette. As a result, the cell body of the postsynaptic neuron should be pulled out \\(Fig. 1, middle right). This should expose the calyx membrane that was originally opposing the postsynaptic neuron."

Apply a gentle suction of the membrane via the pipette every 100-200 s during each patch of cell-attached recordings. Use the transient capacitance increase caused by the gentle suction to correct phase errors offline \\(Fig. 2a). After the experiment, correct phase errors  by re-computing Re and Im traces with the phase shift varied in 2° increments until the projection in the Re trace during a gentle suction \\(Fig. 2a, left) is eliminated \\(Fig. 2b, left). This phase adjustment should also eliminate the visible, persistent change in Re trace associated with the non-flicker up-steps in the Im trace of the same patch \\(Fig. 2a-b, right). With the phase adjustment described above, we occasionally observed flickers in Re trace without accompanying a change in Im trace \\(Fig. 2c), which might reflect  openings and closings of a single ion channel."
