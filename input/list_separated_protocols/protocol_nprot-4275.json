The descriptive information can be a help when it comes to interpreting the data.\r\n\n\n Sample the control. To this end, inject 10 ml of a CO<sub>2</sub>-free gas \\(nitrogen) or standard gas in v<sub>B</sub> using the 60 ml syringe. The gas enters the vial automatically if the evacuation was performed correctly. Since it is impossible to evacuate a vial completely a control measurement has to be taken for the background correction. \r\n\n\n Take a 10 ml sample of ambient air directly over the water surface and inject it into v<sub>AA</sub>. \r\n\n\nAs an alternative, artificial air free of CO<sub>2</sub> \\(nitrogen or from a scrubber) can be used instead of ambient air. In the latter case the results from v<sub>AA</sub> should be the same as those from v<sub>B</sub>. \r\n\n\n Now the main sampling takes place: Fill the syringe with 40 ml water. Create a headspace in the syringe by sampling 20 ml of ambient air. As an alternative, CO<sub>2</sub>-free air can be used to create the headspace. Equilibrate both phases by shaking the syringe for 1 minute under the water surface. Since the saturation of the water and hence the amount of gas that drifts into the gas phase are dependent on the temperature it is important that the equilibration is done at water temperature and therefore below the surface. This could make a significant difference where springs are sampled during the summer, for instance. The temperature of the spring might be below 10°C whilst the air temperature is around 30°C. Also, if the sample is shaken in the air, the temperature of the sampler’s hand could affect the temperature of the solvent and thus the equilibration of both phases. \r\n\n\n Flush the needle of the syringe by discarding 10 ml of the equilibrated gas after equilibration is finished. \r\n\n\n Inject the remaining equilibrated gas into v<sub>EA</sub>. \r\n\n\n Store all vials at approximately 6°C until further analysis can take place. Analyses should be done within 48 hours, especially where higher concentrations are expected <sup>4</sup>. \r\n\n\nSubsequent gas analyses can be performed using an infrared gas analyzer or headspace gas chromatography. The choice of device \\(for instance the detector) depends on the one hand on the laboratory equipment and on the other hand on the anticipated concentration."
