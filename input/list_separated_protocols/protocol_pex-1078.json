Seed murine ESCs (100,000 cells per well, 12-well plate) on MEF plates and incubate at 37℃, 5% CO2 incubator.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>EB formation</strong></p><p>1. Prepare 6-well culture plates coated with 0.2% gelatin solution, before trypsinization of ESCs.</p><p>2.

Add 1 ml of 10% FBS-DMEM medium and pipette cells with 1000&nbsp;ml tip.</p><p>5. Pool the cells and transfer the cells into 6-well plates coated with 0.2% gelatin and incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes to remove feeder cells.</p><p>6. Collect floating ESCs gently without contamination of feeder cells and count the number of cells by using hemacytometer.</p><p>7. Centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes.</p><p>8. Aspirate medium and resuspend the cells with warm FBS-supplemented ES medium without LIF (FBS ES medium).</p><p>9. Seed 1,000-5,000 ESCs in 200&nbsp;ml of FBS ES medium onto each well of a U-bottomed 96-well plate by using 8-channel pipettor.</p><p>10. Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 4 days without changing medium. The cells form aggregate spheres on the next day of seeding.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Generation of heart organoids</strong></p><p><u>Plate coating with LN/ET gel (85.7 μg/cm</u><sup><u>2</u></sup><u>)</u></p><p>1. Before coating plates, thaw 2 mg/ml of LN/ET complex on ice.</p><p>2. Add 30&nbsp;ml of LN/ET complex into a well of&nbsp;8-well chamber slides.</p><p>3. Incubate&nbsp;8-well chamber slides at RT for 2 hours.</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>In vitro </u></em><u>culture of EBs for the generation of heart organoids</u></p><p>6. Warm the heart organoid medium and FGF4.</p><p>7. Mix the heart organoid medium with FGF4 (30-60 ng/ml).</p><p>8. Add 200&nbsp;ml of the medium in each well of LN/ET gel coated&nbsp;8-well chamber slides.</p><p>9. Carefully transfer an EB (showing sphere morphology) cultured for 4 days by using 200&nbsp;ml tips, into a well of LN/ET gel coated&nbsp;8-well chamber slides with the medium.</p><p>10. Maintain cultures in 5% CO2 incubator at 37℃.&nbsp;</p><p>11. Replace medium at day3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13,14, and 15.</p><p>12. From day9, use FGF4-heart organoid medium additionally supplemented BMP4 (50 ng/ml), BIO (2.5 μM), and LIF (1,000 units/ml). In case of long term culture of heart organoids, such as over 15 days culture, carefully transfer heart organoids into iMatrix-411-coated (10.7 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>) chamber slides in 200 μl of heart organoid medium.</p><p>13. Observe the morphogenesis of heart organoids under microscope. These heart organoids usually show the initial beating movement by 3 days, and continue to grow with morphogenetic changes.</p><p>14. Usually collect heart organoids over 9 days of culture after chamber formation. When transfer heart organoids for collecting or performing further analysis, use wide bore tip and/or&nbsp;fine dissection forceps under a stereomicroscope.</p>"
