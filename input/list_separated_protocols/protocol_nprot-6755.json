    "\n- R. chinensis ‘Old Blush’ plants are grown in a greenhouse at 25°C/19°C day/night temperature, with 16h/8h day/night supplemental light provided by sodium vapor and metal halide bulbs. Figure 1a shows a flower photo of ‘Old Blush’.\r\n\n\n- In a pilot experiment, harvest flower buds at different development stages, and assess microspore cytological stage by DAPI staining<sup>12</sup>: prepare a 5µg/mL DAPI working solution in citrate/phosphate buffer containing Triton X-100; dilacerate 2-3 anthers in this solution on a microscope slide, remove anther debris and apply a coverslip; observe with fluorescence microscope under UV excitation. This experiment should allow to identify the correct developmental stage based on approximate bud size and morphology, at which the majority of microspores are at the mid-late uninucleate/early bicellular cytological stages \\(Figure 1e-f), according to plant growing conditions. This stage approximately corresponds to when sepals just start to open up and when petals just become visible between sepal margins \\(Figure 1b).\r\n\n\n- Harvest ca. 10 flower buds at the correct development stage.\r\n\n\n- Surface-sterilize buds with Pursept® A Xpress for 1 minute, followed by a treatment with a bleach solution \\(1.5 % active chlorine) containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 15 minutes, with periodic manual stirring\r\n\n\n- Thoroughly rinse buds 4 times with sterile de-ionized water.\r\n\n\n- Aseptically dissect anthers from buds: longitudinally split open buds using a scalpel blade; then harvest anthers with forceps and transfer them into a glass vial containing 6 mL of B medium.\r\n\n\n- Isolate microspores as previously described7: stir for 2-3 min. at 1500 rpm \\(maximum speed), until the mixture of microspores, anther debris and medium becomes milky; collect the resulting suspension, and filter it through a 40 µm cell strainer \\(nylon sieve).\r\n\n\n- Centrifuge the filtrate at 100 g for 3 minutes; discard supernatant and carefully remove the top green layer of the two-layered pellet \\(which contains anther wall debris), using a 1 mL pipette or a P1000 micro-pipet.\r\n\n\n- Resuspend the whitish pellet composed of microspores in 6 mL B medium and centrifuge at 65 g for 3 minutes, discard supernatant. Repeat this procedure once more.\r\n\n\n- Discard the supernatant and resuspend well the microspore pellet in 3 mL B medium; immediately pipet a 100 µL aliquot for cell counting and for FCR/ DAPI assays.\r\n\n\n- Check microspore viability using FCR test<sup>13</sup>: add FDA \\(to 2 µg/mL) to a microspore suspension aliquot and observe with the fluorescence microscope under blue excitation. Viable microspores display a bright yellow/green fluorescence. A microspore viability rate around 50% or above is appropriate for the subsequent steps. This observation also provides indication about the cytological stage of the purified microspores.\r\n\n\n- Determine microspore number in the purified fraction, using a Malassez counting chamber.\r\n\n\n- Optional: check microspore cytological stages with DAPI staining applied to a microspore suspension aliquot, as described above.\r\n\n\n- Adjust microspore density to 100,000 microspores/mL with B medium.\r\n\n\n- Keep the microspore suspension at 4°C in darkness for 21 days in Falcon 353001 Petri dishes sealed with Parafilm®. Use about 1.5 mL microspore suspension per dish.\r\n\n\n- Rinse microspores twice with cold B medium with centrifugations at 50 g for 3 min at 4°C.\r\n\n\n- Suspend fractions containing about 160,000 microspores in 600 µL of AT12 medium. Incubate in a 12-well plate sealed with Parafilm® at 25°C in the dark.\r\n\n\n- After 3 weeks, replace the medium with 600 µL of fresh AT12 medium, by carefully pipeting with a P200 micropipet; re-seal the 12-well plate with Parafilm® and continue incubation at 25°C in the dark.\r\n\n\n- Observe for developing micro-calli \\(ca. 0.5 mm diameter). Developing micro-calli start to be seen about 8 weeks after subculture \\(Figure 1g).\r\n\n\n- Isolate developing micro-calli, under the stereo-microscope, by carefully pipetting them with a P200 micropipet \\(with cut tip). Subculture them individually in 300 µL of AT12 medium in a 24-well plate sealed with Parafilm® in the same conditions.\r\n\n\n- After 2 weeks, plate individual calli onto CM3 solid medium in 100 x 20 mm round tissue culture dishes \\(30 mL medium per dish), and incubate dishes at 25°C in darkness \\(Figure 1h).\r\n\n\n- After 7 weeks of culture, subculture developing calli once on CM3 medium for 12 weeks \\(30 mL medium per dish, 4 calli/dish), at 25°C in darkness.\r\n\n\n- Check for calli that display somatic embryos \\(Figure 1i).\r\n\n\n- For DNA isolation, harvest developing calli and propagate them by repeated subcultures every 4-6 weeks on callus maintenance medium<sup>10</sup> in 100 x 20 mm round dishes \\(30 mL medium per dish, 9 calli/dish), at 25°C in darkness.\r\n\n\n- For embryo production and further plantlet regeneration, propagate embryogenic calli by repeated subcultures of embryogenic tissues on EMM<sup>11</sup> in 100 x 20 mm dishes \\(33 mL medium per dish, 9 calli/dish), at 25°C with 16/8h day/night regime.\r\n\n\n- For plantlet regeneration, dissect cotyledons from embryogenic calli, plate them onto SIM in 100 x 20 mm dishes \\(33 mL medium per dish, 20 cotyledons/dish) and incubate them at 25°C with 16/8h day/night regime; after 4 weeks, dissect regenerated shoots and transfer them to multiplication medium, incubate them at 22°C with 16/8h day/night regime; propagate and maintain regenerated plantlets \\(Figure",

All developing calli displayed the same homozygous profile indicating that they likely derived from a unique microspore development event. This callus was designated R. chinensis HzRDP12 \\(hereafter RcHzRDP12; Figure 1h,i). The k-mer spectrum of Illumina reads derived from RcHzRDP12 provided the final proof that the genome of RcHzRDP12 genome was homozygous, demonstrating a loss of heterozygosity in ‘Old Blush’ \\(Figure 2b). Experiments exploring the potential of RcHzRDP12 material have revealed that it is possible to maintain the embryogenic capacity of produced calli through several subcultures. Furthermore, we readily able to regenerate plantlets with normal morphological phenotype from RcHzRDP12 somatic embryos \\(Figure 1j). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_"
