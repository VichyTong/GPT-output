We considered these instructions critical to building an accurate database.

In all, this process resulted in nearly a doubling of the number of media in the database, from 1946 to 3672.  In the DSMZ listing \\(http://www.dsmz.de/?id=441), each medium is referenced by an ID number.  We generated unique new media IDs for these media variants by following the base media IDs with a period \\(.) or an underscore \\(_), and then a unique numerical or text string.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAdditionally, many media included in their compositions submedia, which were to be mixed independently and then combined.

However, there are many exceptions to this rule, such as media or submedia compositions that include some volume of water that is not 1 liter, or that contain very small volumes of liquid \\(from, e.g., addition of some volume of ethanol), which should not be considered the ‘final volume’ of the medium by any means.  It was critical to determine the exact volume of media in order to properly convert compound units into concentrations \\(see Steps 9-11).  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo deal with this, we classed media and submedia into categories called ‘fill’ and ‘scale.’  The ‘fill’ tag means that whatever volume a medium has should be ‘filled’ to 1 liter, i.e., that the volume listed should simply be ignored; the ‘scale’ tag means that the concentrations of compounds listed in a medium description should be scaled up with the listed volume until that volume comes out to 1 liter.

For SEED compounds without molecular weights listed, as well as for compounds falling into the “Other” category \\(i.e., defined but not listed in SEED), we curated molecular weights manually based on internet searches.
