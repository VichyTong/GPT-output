The massive amount of mesoglea with different osmotic properties maintains the homeostasis and structural integrity of the thin outer cellular tissue in sea water. However, osmotic changes generated by fixative solutions disrupt this homeostasis, the mesoglea collapses, and the animals disintegrate into the solution inducing cellular degradation. To overcome this technical problem, we developed a simple method to preserve not only the cellular structure but also the animal integrity after fixation."
