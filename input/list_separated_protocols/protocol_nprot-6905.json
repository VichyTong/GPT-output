    "\nTissue preparation\r\n\n\nSince biological soft tissues are composed of light elements that give little contrast in the hard x-ray image, we strongly recommend to label the structure of interest with electron-rich reagents containing high-Z elements \\[8]. Since the tissue is pretreated with organic solvents, lipophilic labels weakly adsorbing to the tissue can dissociate into solvents. \r\n\n\nThe tissue size appropriate for the following procedure is 5 × 5 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup>. If the tissue is larger or smaller than this, aliquot volumes must be multiplied accordingly. The tissue can be cut into small pieces with a width of 0.5-3.0 mm in the last step of the resin soak or before the resin soak.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nResin preparation\r\n\n\nEpoxy resin is prepared by mixing resin liquid and its curing agent. Disposable cups, syringes, and plastic mixing rods provided with the resin kit are used in the following procedure. The obtained resin should be stored in an airtight container.",

The adapters shown in Figure 2 are designed so as to best suit with a sleeved sample and also fit on the nanotomography stage. Figure 2b shows a brass adapter for the SPring-8 nanotomography beamlines. The outer diameter of the adapter is 10.0 mm. Figure 2d shows an invar adapter for the 32-ID beamline of APS. This adapter can be screwed to a kinematic base \\(Figure 2c). \r\n\n\nFor microtomography experiments, capillary samples can be mounted using compound clay \\(Hampton Research, CA, USA). Figure 3 shows adapters for the microtomography beamlines of SPring-8. The outer diameter of the adapter basement is 10.0 mm. To place the tissue at the x-ray position regardless of the capillary length, we prepared several adapters having different upper lengths of 20, 25, 30, and 35 mm \\(Figure 3a). The outer diameter of the upper part is 2.0 mm. The upper end has a hole with a diameter of 1.5 mm and depth of 5 mm. Samples with or without brass sleeves can be mounted by inserting the distal end into the end hole filled with the clay. On the side face of the upper hole, an opening of a 0.5-0.7 mm diameter is created. This vent hole prevents sample drifts due to pressurized air remaining in clay \\(Figure 3a). \r\n\n\nFigure 3b shows adapters for the pellet samples. The upper ends of these adapters have flat faces. Pellet samples can be attached on the flat face using epoxy glue or double-sided sticky tape. After data collection, the samples can be recovered by snapping them off the adapter.   \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTiming\r\n\n\nFor nanotomography experiments, the sample should be prepared at least one week before the data collection. This is because the resin may deform immediately after curing. Samples should be secured with set screws at least one hour before data collection to settle any mechanical creep caused by the screwing. Samples should be placed in the beamline hutch at least one hour before data collection to equilibrate the sample temperature with that of the hutch. Temperature fluctuations of a few tenths of a degree or mechanical creep of several tens of nanometers can degrade the image quality. \r\n\n\nIn microtomography experiments, the sample mounting using clay should be finished at least one hour before data collection. This eliminates blurs due to the sample mounting. If the target resolution is coarser than 5 μm, no hold time is needed since drifts are not discernible for most samples."
