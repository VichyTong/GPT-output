    "\nAligning single particles images without the assumption of symmetry is a multi-factorial process. Through a series of iterative steps it is possible to identify the asymmetric features within an image, orient about them accordingly, and then refine the model. The following steps \\(_also see_ the online methods and supplementary figure 8 of the related article) outline the process of asymmetric orientation determination and have the prerequisite that accurate icosahedral alignment parameters \\(i.e. orientations and centers). Additionally, this methodology relies on the production of a variety of masks and reference projection images, each of which is used at specific points in the refinement to hone in on the true asymmetric orientations. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n",

Using a dynamic masking strategy you can make it stand out from the highly symmetric capsid and DNA, by maximally excluding non-target objects in the 2D raw particle images. Assuming the tail is a constant feature in P-SSP7, different particle orientations cause the tail projection in the raw 2D images to occur in different locations and have different shapes \\(Fig. 2a-b). To optimize computational time, create a database of all possible masks, indexed by projection orientation. As Azimuthal rotation \\(_AZ_ defined in EMAN) does not appreciably change the shape of a mask projection, do not consider it as a projection parameter. As such, project the masks for the database along the initial 3D tail mask for only two of the three Euler angles \\(altitude \\(_Alt_) and in-plane \\(_Phi_)), as defined in the EMAN coordinate system.

In the current implementation of our program, the total computational time is dictated by the time it takes to load all of these masks into memory, and is relatively independent of the process of orientation determination. As there is a trade off between number of masks and computational time, instead of creating a prolific database of tight masks, merge several neighboring masks together to create a set of looser, but more computationally efficient, masks. Accordingly, with the exception of the first projection at 0°, merge every three consecutive projections to the 3<sup>rd</sup> one \\(Fig. 2c). Under this scheme you produce 11 projection masks from 0° to 90° \\(_Alt_) at an interval of 9°. The next step generates in-plane \\(_Phi_) rotation masks from 0° to 360°.

Just as before, to minimize computational restraints, merge every 20 rotations and index them to the angle corresponding to the middle \\(10<sup>th</sup>) mask \\(Fig. 2d).
