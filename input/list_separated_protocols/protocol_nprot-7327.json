Cutting too far above the mature tRNA PCR band will result in pre-tRNA being brought through the purification, which will reduce the amount of reads generated for tailed mature tRNA.   In initial tests and earlier version of computational analyses, tails were observed on the pre-tRNA, but its processing was atypical and difficult to predict sample to sample.  Most consistent results were obtained when focusing analyses on the mature tRNA.
