Then click the “Init. alignDB” button, which will call init\\init_alignDB.pl to build the skeleton of the database.\r\n\n\n    Step 3: generate two-way analysis database. Click the “Gene. alignDB” button which will call init\\gene_alignDB.pl to analysis alignments and build the database.\r\n\n\n    Step 4: update features using Ensembl annotations. Click the “Feature” tab, change nothing and click the “Upd. feature” button, which will run init\\update_feature.pl.\r\n\n\n    Step 5: update misc features. Click the “Misc” tab. Click “Upd. slippage” to run init\\update_indel_slippage.pl and then click “Upd. isw” to run init\\update_isw_indel_id.pl.\r\n\n\n    Step 6: do statistics and get results. Then click “Common stat” button. An Excel workbook with 25 worksheets will be generated.\r\n\n\n    Step 7: charting.

Fig.2 is an example workbook."

This can be accomplished by joining two two-way comparisons, which share a common target sequence.\r\n\n\n    Step 1: build another two-way comparison. You can just do steps 1-3 and omit step 4-7 if you don’t need statistical analysis for the new two-way database.\r\n\n\n    Step 2: generate three-way analysis database. Load two completed databases into “first db” and “second db”. Generate “goal db” name with the default naming rule. Leave the “T/Q/R:” options unchanged, and click the “Ref outgroup” button. See Fig.3 for an example.\r\n\n\n    Step 3: update two-way features. Three-way comparison database is also a legal two-way database. Do step 4-5 of two-way comparison to update the new three-way database.\r\n\n\n    Step 4: update three-way features. Go to “Misc” tab in the “Three-way” pane and click the “Upd. CpG” button to run extra\\update_snp_cpg.pl.\r\n\n\n    Step 5: do statistics and get results. Then click “Three stat” button which will run stat\\three_stat_factory.pl. An Excel workbook with 11 worksheets will be generated.\r\n\n\n    Step 6: charting. This step is almost the same as step 7 in Two-way comparison. Just click the “Three chart” button, which will run stat\\three_chart_factory.pl."
