        "body": "Manipulation: Upon arrival, take oocytes out of the vials using a 1ml tips on a Gilson pipette, and placed in a 30mm dish on the heated stage of a Stereomicroscope. Oocytes are then placed in the equilibrated medium of the 4-well dishes and placed in the incubator at 37 degree Celsius  and 5% CO2 \\(or 6% CO2, 89% N2, 5% O2). 2-3 oocytes are placed on the stage heated to 37 degree Celsius, in cytochalasinB free medium and the zona is drilled using the Lykos laser near the spindle visualized by birefringence\\[25]. Drilling is performed at low laser power, of 200μs, 90% power. The drilling in the absence of cytochalasinB serves to prevent oocyte leakage. Two small openings in the zona pellucida are made 90-180 degrees apart from each other. The first polar body may be ablated using 2-3 direct laser pulses or removed at this point to avoid later confusion with the somatic cell to be transferred. The oocyte is then transferred into cytochalasinB containing medium \\(5μg/ml), turned until a spindle can be visualized using microtubule birefringence \\(Oosight), the zona is again drilled with the laser to gain access to the spindle. Be careful to have the spindle, the focus of the laser on the zona and the enucleation pipette all in the same plane of focus. If this is not the case, the spindle cannot be removed or seems to be moving away from the pipette when trying to aspirate it. After enucleation, oocytes are allowed to recover for 5-10 minutes from the cytochalasinB prior to fusion. CytochalasinB makes the cytoplasm look uneven, but is reversible within a few minutes. They may be washed in Global medium and returned to the incubator, or left on the heated stage the drops without cytochalasinB. While recovering from cytochalasinB, a new batch of 2-3 oocytes is enucleated. Nuclear transfer is performed as follows: a small drop of somatic cells is placed in one of the cytochalasinB free drops. Enucleated oocytes are placed in calcium-free medium. One somatic cell is aspirated into the pipette, and exposed to the virus for 10-20s \\(Figure 2a). There is no need to expel the somatic cell entirely. They become very sticky and more difficult to handle if they are expelled entirely. Fusogenic agents like Sendai virus act by affecting the integrity of the plasma membrane, and therefore increase permeability to ions contained in the culture medium. The membrane of a cell becomes more fragile when exposed to Sendai virus and the cell is prone to undergo lysis. This adverse effect of the virus lasts longer than the immediate time of incubation with the virus. Therefore, the minimal amount of fusogenic agent required to achieve fusion is recommended, to preserve integrity of the plasma membrane of the oocyte as much as possible, while still achieving fusion. To minimize exposure of the egg to the virus, do not expose the holding pipette to the virus and on the way back to the drop containing the oocytes, pass through another drop to get rid of excess virus. Drill the zona and make a very small opening \\(Figure 2b), insert the somatic cell with the side exposed to the virus facing the plasma membrane, and ensure that the zona pellucida presses on the somatic cell to ensure contact between the somatic plasma membrane and the oocyte plasma membrane. If the somatic cell is GFP positive, fusion can usually be confirmed within 5 minutes by briefly checking the fluorescence in the oocyte. The oocyte is returned to the incubator in calcium-free medium for up to 1h. Checkpoint: the investigator may want to fix a few oocytes to determine chromosome condensation. Before activation, the oocyte is returned to Global total for at least 10 minutes."

They are ready for the electrical pulse when they sink to the bottom of the drop containing fusion medium. The presence of several zona openings avoids leaking out of the oocytes and possible loss.

About 70,000 mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(MEFs) per well of a 4-well dish are seeded 3-4 hours before derivation in warm fibroblast medium on a surface that had been coated for approximately 10 minutes with 0.1% gelatin. Time before derivation is just sufficient for the MEFs to attach to the bottom of a 4-well dish and spread out. The MEF layer should cover all plastic, but should not be dense. The timing of derivation from blastocysts should be on day two after blastulation is first observed. Trophectoderm cells are ablated with laser pulses at 400μs pulses, 90% power, as described\\[31]. No more than one pulse per cell is applied, and not all trophectoderm cells need to be ablated. If the blastocyst did not hatch from the zona pellucida on its own, laser pulses may be used to ablate the zona pellucida with gentle pipetting to remove remaining pieces. Plating is conducted in medium containing KnockOut DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% Knockout-SR and 10% quality-tested FBS, 10μM Rock inhibitor Y-27632, 2μM thiazovivin, non-essential amino acids \\(1%), 10ng/ml bFGF, Glutamax \\(1%), PennStrep \\(1%), and 1x 2-mercaptoethanol. Two days after plating, remaining trophectoderm cells are ablated using laser pulses at 400μs pulses, 90% power, which may be repeated until most trophectoderm cells are gone \\(see Extended Data Figure 5 of Reference \\[32]. Trophectoderm cells are rather flat and large and may inhibit growth of inner cell mass \\(ICM) cells. If the investigator cannot see ICM cells, or cannot distinguish them from trophectoderm, wait another day and check again. Outgrowths can be apparent as soon as 3-4 days after plating, but may take up to two and a half weeks to be fully-grown and ready for picking. Medium changes are partial every 1-2 days. Once an outgrowth is apparent, partial medium changes should be conducted without Y-27632 or thiazovivin. Picking is done when colonies reach a size of about 1mm in diameter and colony fragments are plated into 2-3 wells of a 4-well dish coated with MEFs. MEFs must be fresh, meaning no older than 12 hours. If colonies emerge in several wells, enzymatic passaging may begin after just one manual passage. FBS-containing medium is gradually replaced by using standard ES cell medium \\(substituting FBS with Knockout-SR and DMEM/F12 with Knockout-DMEM). Enzymatic passaging is done using 10μM Rock inhibitor Y-27632 for the first day after plating."
