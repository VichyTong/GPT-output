Multiplex libraries and sequence with standard Illumina sequencing primers on commercial sequencing platforms. We have tested sequencing of Paired-Tag libraries on HiSeq 2500/4000, NextSeq 500 or NovaSeq 6000 platforms. Libraries should be loaded at recommended concentrations according to manufacturer’s instructions. At least 50 and 100 sequencing cycles are needed for Read1 and Read2, respectively. For example: using PE 50 + 7 + 100 cycles (Read1 + Index 1 + Read2) on a NextSeq 500 platform with 150-cycle sequencing kits, or PE 100 +7 +100 cycles on a NovaSeq 6000 platform with 200-cycle sequencing kits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>D. Initial data processing and QC</strong></p><p>1. All scripts for initial Paired-Tag data processing are available from GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/cxzhu/Paired-Tag\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/cxzhu/Paired-Tag</a>). Download and perform the data pre-processing steps according to instructions on the GitHub repository.</p><p>2. Initial Paired-Tag data processing includes (a) extract barcode sequences from Read2, (b) assign barcodes combinations to cellular barcodes references (assign barcode sequences to ID of 12 sample tubes and 2 rounds of 96 wells), (c) mapping the assigned reads to reference genome and (d) generating cell-to-features matrices for downstream analyses.&nbsp;</p><p>3. The following metrics during initial Paired-Tag data processing can be used for quality control. For step 2(a), typically &gt;85% and &gt;75% of DNA and RNA reads will have full ligated barcodes. For step 2(b), &gt;85% of both DNA and RNA reads can uniquely assigned to one cellular barcode with no more than 1 mismatch. For step 2(c), typically &gt;85% of assigned reads can be mapped to the reference genome; depending on which histone mark targeted, from 60% to &gt;95% of assigned DNA reads can be mapped to the reference genome.</p><p>4. Cell-to-features matrices generated from initial data processing steps is a standard sparse matrix format which can be used for down-stream analyses with commonly used single-cell analysis software.</p><p><br></p>"
