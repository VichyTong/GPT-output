We recommend TRIzol reagent to isolate total RNA from higher eukaryotes \\(both animal and plant). For yeast cells, hot-phenol approach1 tends to give the most reproducible results. To avoid potential biases that may incur during library construction, it is preferable to start with ~150 μg total RNA if the sample is easy to be obtained. For low-abundance samples, it is possible to reduce the amount to 10 μg. In this protocol, we use Drosophila embryos to demonstrate the PEAT strategy.

Purify the final library with ZYMO DNA clean & concentrator-5 kit. Load multiple times for mixture more than 700 μl. Elute with 30 μl nuclease-free water.
