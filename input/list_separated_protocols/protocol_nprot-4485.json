After filtration through the pink nucleospin filter the flow-through is carefully pipetted to a fresh 1.5 mL tube, avoiding the pellet, which is often formed at this stage. An additional centrifuge round was used to avoid a small pellet; the clear liquid was used in following steps according the manufacturer’s protocol. As restriction enzymes are very sensitive to proteins and other contamination we only selected samples with high purity, specifically 260/280 and 260/230 ratios of at least 1.8 and 1.5 respectively).
