Each sample is maintained under constant temperature \\(37ºC) in a water bath. Transmittance spectra are acquired in the range of 680-2500 nm with 2-nm step intervals. The NIR instrument records 10 consecutive spectra of each urine samples."

To identify the wavelength range related to estrous, the difference spectrum is obtained for each year by subtracting the average spectrum of all days except for the previous, the next day and the day of the estrogen peak \\(estrous state) from the average spectrum of these three days of estrous state. Data are initially pre-treated using Savitzky-Golay second derivative polynomial ﬁlter \\(window size=9) with smoothing. After that, second derivative plot of all-year samples is used to identify the water absorbance bands which showed strong response to changes in estrous state. By reference to the 12 characteristic water wavelength ranges reported by Tsenkova<sup>4</sup>, 12 characteristic wavelength ranges showing strong absorbance related to estrous are found. The 12 bands specific for the estrous are selected as the WAMACs."

After that, the normalized values at the only WAMACs are applied to the following data analysis.\r\n\n\nIn Hierarchical cluster analysis \\(HCA), distances between pairs of samples are calculated and compared. Relatively small distances imply that the samples are similar, while dissimilar samples are separated by relatively large distances. The dendrogram classification is employed using Euclidean distance and complete-link clustering algorithm.\r\n\n\nAquagram<sup>11</sup> is the star chart which displays above-described normalized values at WAMACs on the axes originating from the center of the graph. The relationship between estrous state and the absorbance change at WAMACs, i.e. WASP, is estimated by comparing aquagrams for the days of high and low estrogen values."
