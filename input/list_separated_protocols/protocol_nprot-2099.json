If the drug will be given multiple times of the day, give the piece of vehicle jelly to mice at those times. PAUSE POINT: In our experience, once being trained and have overcome the initial innate avoidance for the novel stimuli, i.e. jelly, mice maintain the interest to the jelly even after jelly has been absent for a few weeks \\(3 weeks are the longest break occurred in our studies)."
