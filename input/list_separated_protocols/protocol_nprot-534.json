    "\nOverall methodology for in silico designing of the oligonucleotides required for artificial gene synthesis has been divided into various task levels \\(I to VI) such that each task consists of various respective steps.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTask I: Generation of &#x2018;Preliminary DNA Sequence&#x2019;\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nThe peptide/protein sequence of interest \\(which ought to be more than 20 amino acids long) should be first back-translated to derive a &#x2018;Preliminary DNA Sequence&#x2019;. The peptide/protein sequence should be back-translated using the software, &#x2018;Gene Design &#x3B2;2.0&#x2019; \\(Richardson et al, 2006), which is accessible from the following link: \"http://baderlab.bme.jhu.edu/gd/\":http://baderlab.bme.jhu.edu/gd/",

In long-run this may become a problem since these repetitive sequences may cause the DNA sequence to form secondary structures like hair-pin loops \\(due to self-annealing) or wrong dimer products \\(due to inter- or intra-molecular interactions) during later annealing cycles. Therefore, such DNA repeats may interfere with gene-construction \\(Engels & Uhlmann, 1989). In fact on the level of mRNA, certain inverted-repetitive sequences may lead to formation of RNA-secondary loop structures, which may hamper the translation of proteins \\(Looman & et al., 1986). In order to avoid these repetitive DNA sequences from causing problems in gene-constructions, the phenomenon of codon-degeneracy must be utilized to change our ‘preliminary DNA sequence’ into ‘Trial DNA Sequence’ such that the ‘trial DNA sequence’ codes for the same peptide as the preliminary sequence but both differ in their sequence especially at the third position of various codons \\(Engels & Uhlmann, 1989; Griffiths et al, 1999). This strategy may prove to be useful in getting rid of these repetitive sequences while still not altering the peptide coded by the sequence. These sequences are called ‘Trial DNA Sequences’ since these are still under test for repeats, restrictions sites, secondary structures etc."
