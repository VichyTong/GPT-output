Rats were fed a normal salt diet \\(0.49% NaCl Teklad TD.96208) and water ad libitum. \r\n\n\nFor all animal surgeries, proper aseptic technique was used, and all drapes, supplies, surgery tools and gloves were sterilized.  Rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and given a s.c. injection of carprofen \\(5 mg/kg) and buprenorphine \\(0.1 mg/kg) to minimize pain post surgery.  Just lateral to the left rib cage, hair is shaved, and the skin prepared by three alternative wipes of 10% betadine \\(Purdue Pharma, Stamford, CT) and 70% ethanol \\(in water).  A small incision is made through the skin and muscle, and the kidney exposed.  The adrenal gland of the left kidney was carefully freed from the upper pole of the renal capsule before the renal pedicle is ligated with 5-0 silk suture \\(Ethicon, Summerville, NJ) and the kidney removed. The muscle is sutured closed with 4-0 prolene suture \\(Ethicon) and the skin is then closed with surgical staples.  The area is cleaned with 3% hydrogen peroxide in water, and the incision is given 0.25% Marcaine + 0.5% lidocaine \\(mixed 50/50).  The animal is placed in a clean cage and allowed to recover for 7 days before the iPRECIO® surgery.  Animals were closely monitored after surgery and if they lost more than 20% body weight, appeared lethargic or lost righting ability, they would’ve been euthanized and excluded from the study; however, in this study that was not observed, thus all animals in this study were included."
