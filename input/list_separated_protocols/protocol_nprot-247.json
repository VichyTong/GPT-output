"\n1] Weigh out 1.4 g \\(10 mmol) of ethyl pyrrole-2-carboxylate into a 50 mL round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar. Fit the flask with a water condenser in the main neck and also a rubber septum in the second neck. Place a rubber septum into the of top of the condenser. Flush the flask with argon and maintain under a positive pressure of argon by use of an argon balloon. Place the flask into an oil bath on the hotplate stirrer and fit a digital temperature probe to the hotplate stirrer.\r\n\n\n2] Transfer 10 mL of distilled acetonitrile into the flask using a glass syringe and reusable 21 gauge needle. Turn the magnetic stirrer on. \r\n\n\n3] Transfer 4.2 mL \\(30 mmol) of distilled triethylamine into the flask using a second glass syringe and reusable 21 gauge needle. \r\n\n\n4] Weigh out 61 mg \\(0.5 mmol) of 4-di\\(methylamino)pyridine into a weighing boat and transfer to the reaction vessel by rapid removal of the rubber septum and subsequent replacement following addition.\r\n\n\n5] Weigh out 3.1 g \\(14 mmol) of di- _tert_-butyl dicarbonate into a weighing boat and transfer to the reaction vessel by rapid removal of the rubber septum and subsequent replacement following addition.\r\n\n\n6] Heat the reaction vessel to 50 &#xB0;C and stir at this temperature for 48 hours.\r\n\n\n7] Cool the reaction to room temperature by lifting the vessel out of the oil bath. \r\n\n\n8] Transfer the reaction mixture into a 100 mL separating funnel containing water \\(30 mL) and diethyl ether \\(30 mL). Separate the layers and extract the aqueous layer with two 30 mL portions of diethyl ether. Dry the combined organic layers with sodium sulfate \\(approx. 1 g).\r\n\n\n9] Filter the mixture through filter paper into a round-bottomed flask and evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator. PAUSE POINT: The reaction mixture can be left overnight at room temperature.\r\n\n\n10] Purify the desired product by flash column chromatography on silica gel eluting with 1:9 acetone to petroleum spirit to yield the desired product as a pale yellow oil."
