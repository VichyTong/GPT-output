"\n<p>1. Grow an O/N culture (approximately 200mL) in liquid medium (bacteria or yeast) in a shaker at the optimal temperature for the particular microorganism.</p><p>2. Split the culture in 10 tubes, (each with 20mL) and centrifuge to pellet the cells (1minute at maximum speed).</p><p>3. Ressuspend each pellet in 20mL of PBS 1x.</p><p>4. Repeat the centrifugation and wash steps twice.</p><p>5. Centrifuge again and ressuspend the cells in 1mL of 4% PFA solution.</p><p>NOTE! PFA is toxic, perform this step in a fume hood.</p><p>6. Incubate 5 minutes at RT.</p><p>7. Centrifuge again and ressuspend the cells in 1mL of PBS.</p><p>8. Combine all the tubes into one cell suspension.</p><p>9. Read optical density at 600 nm (OD600) in a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.</p><p>NOTE! Mix the cell suspension well before measuring.</p><p>10. Calculate the concentration of the bacterial or yeast suspension.</p><p>(This can be done using a standard curve previously obtained by measuring the OD600 of a series of dilutions of the microbial culture and by plating those cultures in agar plates and counting the cell numbers).</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
