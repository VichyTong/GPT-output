Skyline provides very user friendly interface for manually inspecting, and correcting the isolate peptide signals for quantitation. This process can dramatically improve the accuracy of quantitation results. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA. In a typical example, it takes less than 20 seconds to correct isolation windows of a cross-linked peptides quantified across six samples \\(two conformational states, each with triplicated MS analysis).

A dot product value can range between 0 and 1, and 1 indicates a perfect match. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nv. Inspect the isolated peptide signal according to following criteria:\r\n\n\n==*== Isolation window includes the whole elution peak.\r\n\n\n==*== Isolated elution window agrees with the retention time \\(RT) of identified MS2 events or aligned identification RT. \r\n\n\n==*== Isotope dot product value is 0.9 or higher\r\n\n\n==*== If Isotope dot product value is lower than 0.9, exam the MS1 spectrum of the selected peptide by clicking on the elution peak in the chromatogram \\(a new window will appear with MS1 spectrum). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nvi.
