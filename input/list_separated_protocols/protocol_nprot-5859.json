An approximate starting point for hES/iPS cells would be to perform a dilution series across the 6 wells using a range of 0.5–5 μl/virus in 1 ml media/well. Fix and stain cells 48 h after the addition of doxycycline using standard procedures. Determine infection efficiency for each reprogramming factor by estimating the fraction of infected cells and use DAPI staining to mark all nuclei. Optimal reprogramming efficiencies will be achieved when approximately 80-90 % of cells express Ascl1, Dlx2."
