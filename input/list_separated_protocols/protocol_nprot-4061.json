To make plates, thaw aliquots at 4 °C overnight before diluting 1 in 15 with chilled KO-DMEM. Coat each well of one 6 well plate with 1 ml of the new dilution. Allow plates to set at 4 °C overnight and warm for at least 20 min at room temperature before use. Seal plates with parafilm to prevent evaporation before storage. Upon use, aspirate off excess solution and replace with the appropriate volume of MEF-CM prior to hESC passaging. In emergency circumstances, plates can be made on the day of passaging and allowed to set for a minimum of 4 hours at room temperature before use. Homogeneity of the coating can be verified using a phase contrast light microscope. Plates stored at 4 °C should be used within 2 weeks. \r\n\n\nCritical Step: Matrigel sets rapidly at room temperature, to avoid gelling and clumping, ensure that Matrigel solutions are defrosted slowly at 4 °C. Do not let the Matrigel-coated wells dry out after excess is removed."
