However, the mild fixation step described here facilitates analysis of ROS production in GFP marked clones, as completely unfixed GFP samples tend to produce clones with fuzzy boundaries. The length of the fixation is crucial, and may have to be determined empirically for the tissue of interest and particular variant of GFP used: too little fixation will produce fuzzy GFP boundaries but will significantly retain ROS signal, excessive fixation will produce clear GFP boundaries but will  compromise ROS signal."
