        "body": "Adult mouse ventricular myocytes were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. William H. Barry \\(Cardiology Division, University of Utah, Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, USA) and were isolated from 129S6 wild type mice \\(Taconic Laboratories) according to previously reported methods <sup>10</sup> \\(Note: As this protocol deals with immunocytochemisry and confocal microscopic imaging, isolation of adult ventricular cardiomyocytes is not elaborated)."

The concentration and timing for staining should be standardized by the end user."

        "title": "**4│**",
        "body": "Wash the cells with PBS twice and resuspend in fresh PBS ▲CRITICAL STEP All the steps after labeling with MitoTracker should be performed in the dark or by covering the tubes containing the cells with aluminum foil to avoid photo-bleaching of the dye."

Suspended the pelleted cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS maintained at 30 ºC and fix for 30 mins with gentle mixing of the contents by inverting the tube using a nutating mixer. ▲CRITICAL STEP  It is important to maintain the cells at 30 ºC when they are viable and centrifuged at low g force to pellet cardiomyocytes, since these would affect cell viability and morphology.\r\n\n\n?Troubleshooting"

The excitation lasers used were Argon 488 to image nucleus stained with Syto 11, HeNe laser 543 and 633 to image F-actin stained with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin and mitochondria stained with MitoTracker Deep Red 633 respectively. Three dimensional z-projection views were obtained by deconvolution and volume rendering of the z-stacks using Olympus FluoView software and Leica Confocal Software \\(Leica Microsystems, Version 2.5, LCS Lite, Mannheim, Germany). Volume visualization of the stacks and 3D movies were generated using Voxx \\(http://www.nephrology.iupui.edu/imaging/voxx/). <sup>11</sup>"
