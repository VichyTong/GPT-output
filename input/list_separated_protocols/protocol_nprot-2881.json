After adding the citrate solution, the initial pale yellow colour of the Au\\(III) solution should become instantly colourless and then gradually change to deep red due to the nanoparticle formation. The reduction process usually takes a few minutes to occur. During this process, a precursor called acetone dicarboxylic acid is formed as a result of the oxidation of citrate. This precursor plays the roles of precursor, reducing and nucleating agents. The Au\\(III) ions are then reduced to Au\\(I) and when the solution becomes saturated of Au\\(I) atoms, they start to precipitate in the form of nanoparticles. The citrate acts as capping and stabilizing agent that covers the nanoparticles’ surface avoiding nanoparticle aggregation38."
