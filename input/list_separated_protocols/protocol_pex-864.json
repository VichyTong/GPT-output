"\n<p><u>Preparation of K562 cells for single-cell RNA sequencing (60 min)</u></p><p><em>Comment: We describe here a workflow for preparation of K562 cells for 10X Genomics. In general, cells for TAP-seq with 10X Genomics are prepared in the same way as cells for classical 10X Genomics.</em></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count live cells using cell counter and trypan blue live dead stain</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect cells by centrifugation (200 g, 5 min, room temperature)</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discard supernatant</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuspend in FACS buffer to achieve a cell concentration of 5-10 million cells per ml</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter through cell strainer</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add viability dye, e.g. DRAQ7</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort viable cells by flow cytometry into collection tube containing cell collection buffer (Figure 2).&nbsp;All cell sorting can be performed at room temperature. Collected cells are stored on ice until use.</p><p><em>Comment: Flow buffer and cell collection buffer are compatible with 10X Genomics and other single-cell platforms. Same is true for DRAQ7 and other viability stains (validated for DAPI and PI).</em></p><p><em>Optional: Cells expressing Cas9 as a fusion protein with a fluorescent tag (e.g. dCas9-BFP-KRAB) can be enriched for BFP-expression. We generally enriched for cells expressing intermediate to high Cas9 expression level (see&nbsp;Figure 2).</em></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If high numbers of cells are available: Sort 0.1-1 million cells into 5 ml FACS tubes containing 300 µl cell collection buffer. Collect cells by centrifugation (300 g, 7 min, room temperature) and discard supernatant. Resuspend pellet in PBS by pipetting several times and dilute to achieve a cell concentration compatible with 10X Genomics, e.g. 1 million cells per ml. Double-check cell numbers and absence of multiplets by cell counting.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If low numbers of cells are available: Sort cells directly into 20 µl cell collection buffer provided in a 1.5 ml tube. Cell numbers are deduced from flow cytometry counts, and by adding a correction factor of ~ 1.5x to 2x (has to be adapted, start with 1.5x). Cells are not counted again.</p><p><em>Example: The correction factor considers cell loss during handling of cells after sorting, and the dilution factor during 10X Genomics single-cell Master Mix preparation and Chromium run. If 250 cells should be sequenced (and a correction factor 1.5x), sort 250 x 1.5 = 375 cells into 20 µl cell collection buffer. Approximately 3.5 nl (100 µm nozzle) or 7 nl (130 µm nozzle) liquid will be added on top per sorted cell. After sort is finished, vortex quickly to collect cells from tube wall, spin cells shortly, and measure volume. Then fill up with collection buffer to 33.8 µl, which is the volume added into the 10X Genomics single-cell master mix.</em></p><p><br></p><p><u>10X Genomics Chromium run (90 min)</u></p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare single cell master mix on ice according to the 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell 3’ RNA-seq v2 protocol. Mix by pipetting and place on ice. 10X Genomics RT Enzyme Mix can be replaced by Superscript IV RT or not. 10X RT primer (template switch oligo) is replaced by low TE buffer (or H2O).</p><p>RT Reagent Mix <strong>50 µl</strong></p><p>low TE buffer <strong>3.8 µl</strong></p><p>Additive A <strong>2.4 µl</strong></p><p>Superscript IV RT <strong>10 µl</strong></p><p><em>Comment: The protocol should be adaptable to Chromium single-cell RNAseq v3, and the more recent NextGEM protocol, since the PCR handle sequence on the 10X bead oligo is identical between all three 10X versions (target sequence of Partial Read 1 primer). Further, the steps until cDNA amplification are largely identical. We here follow the 10X v2 protocol until cDNA amplification.&nbsp;</em></p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill unused wells of a single cell A Chip with 50 % Glycerol, as described in the 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell 3’ RNA-seq v2 protocol.</p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add H2O and cells to single cell master mix (see 10X Genomics Chromium single-cell 3’ RNA-seq v2 protocol cell dilution table), mix by pipetting, and transfer 90 µl of cell suspension to 10X Chip A well “1”.</p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare 10X Genomics beads by vortexing for 30 sec, and slowly dispense 27 to 40 µl of the bead suspension into 10X Chip A well “2”. 40 µl loading volume are suggested by 10X Genomics, but volume can be reduced to 27 µl, since beads are not used up completely during the run.</p><p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill 10X Chip A well “3” with 230 µl partitioning oil, attach 10X gasket, and start run on the Chromium Controller.</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;After run, check volume in GEM collection outlet and transfer 110 µl of GEM emulsion&nbsp;into emulsion safe PCR 8-tube strip.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Comment: 10X protocol transfers 100 µl of the GEM emulsion only, but we generally observe a higher volume of GEMs in the collection outlet, allowing a 10% increase in cell recovery.</em></p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;GEM-RT incubation in a thermal cycler [45 min 53&nbsp;°C – 5 min 85&nbsp;°C – hold 4&nbsp;°C].

The cycle number depends on the number of cells, the amount of input cDNA, the number of amplified genes, and the expression levels of these genes. As a start, we suggest 12 cycles, which should result in&nbsp;³&nbsp;10 ng of PCR product. Too high cycle numbers of PCR1-3 might result in a high MW product after PCR3 peaking around 1,000 to 1,500 bp; we generally do not observe any issues from this high MW product after Illumina sequencing and data analysis (product might not cluster efficiently during Illumina run preparation).</em></p><p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;After PCR is finished, collect liquid by short centrifugation and place at room temperature.
