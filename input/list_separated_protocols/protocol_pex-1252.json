    "\n<p><strong><u>Assay for IFN-γ release to measure NKCA</u></strong></p><p><strong>Methods and materials:</strong></p><p>We will prospectively assess prefixed baseline blood parameters and follow them up with the same parameters at every seven days for a total of 4 such readings. To avoid any confounding factor of glycemic control and pre-existing increased levels of chronic diseases that might influence the results of the study, we will include only T2DM patients with reasonable glycemic control (HbA1c &lt;7%) and without any other chronic diseases. We will also measure the baseline IL-10 since it is a stimulant for NKA, which might add to the bias. We will adjust for any discrepancies of baseline BMI, HbA1c, age, eGFR, duration of diabetes, IL-10, and baseline blood parameters. We will divide patients into two groups meeting the inclusion criteria (figure",

            "– one will not be having any SGLT2I and the other group will be put on Empagliflozin 25 mg as per current guidelines. We will measure few baseline parameters and those will be re-assessed again after 4 weeks of treatment. We are taking young T2DM patients without any chronic diseases. If they have any of these, then the minimum on-going period for these drugs should be at least >6 months. We target a well-controlled diabetic population since IFN-γ assay is very much dependent on HbA1c. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Process of Interferon gamma release assay:</strong></p><p>NKA-IFN γ is measured by NK Vue (ATGen, Seongnam-si, Korea), an in vitro diagnostic sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [23]. One milliliter whole blood will be collected, transferred to a <em>NK-Vue™</em> test tube and incubated for 17 h at 37°C. This assay works on the principle that incubation with Promoca (proprietary immunomodulatory cytokine) stimulates NK cells present in whole blood. Supernatants from the incubated tubes will be stored at -70°C [<strong>24; 25</strong>]. </p><p>The stimulated NK cells will secrete IFN-γ, which is quantified using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). During ELISA, the samples are pipetted into microwell plate and allowed to react with anti- IFN-γ antibody already pre-absorbed on it. Then, the unbound material is washed and the wells are filled with HRP-bound secondary antibody. Next, unbound antibody-HRP complex is washed. Next, a substrate solution is added, which leads to development of color that can be quantified by measuring absorbance of the solution at 450 nm. The absorbance of the solution can help in determining the levels of IFN-γ secreted by the cells. The principle of the machine <em>NK VUE ®</em> is discussed in <em>figure 2 </em>[26]. </p><p><strong>Assay method:</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>Step 1: Blood collection, blood culture, plasma harvest</p><p>• Collect and culture the blood into NK VUE tube and use the plasma harvested only from these blood samples. </p><p>Step 2: ELISA </p><p>Key recommendations:</p><p>•       All the samples and standards must be promptly loaded into wells (preferably in 15 min) to avoid time-delay related variations. </p><p>•       All the reagents, antibody-coated microwell strips, and plasma samples must be used at room temperature. </p><p>•       Prior to loading into the well, plasma samples must be thawed and centrifuged at 11,500 ×g at room temperature for 1 min. </p><p>•       The microwell strips that are not required should be packed and stored back into the refrigerator. </p><p>•       Dilute the 20X washing solution 1:19 to obtain a 1X working solution. For full plate, prepare 1 L of 1X washing solution by mixing 50 mL of 20X washing solution with 950 mL double-distilled or Milli Q water. The 1 X solution can be stored at room temperature in a tightly closed bottle for 3 months. In case of the development of crystals in the solution, gently warm the container using an incubator or a water bath. </p><p>•       To reconstitute lyophilized IFN-γ standard, mix it in water gently until dissolved completely. Avoid mixing by vortexing or pipetting to prevent foaming. </p><p>•       Do not allow the strips to dry out or become empty. Keep the next solution always prepared and pipetted. </p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p><p>1. Use 500 μL distilled or deionized water to reconstitute each vial of LPC, HPC, and lyophilized IFN-γ-standard. Gently mix the solution until each component is completely dissolved. The Final concentration for each component will be: </p><p>LPC: 165 pg/mL</p><p>HPC: 1000 pg/mL</p><p>IFN-γ: 4000 pg/mL</p><p>Only 100-200 µL of these solutions would be needed for each run. Store the remaining solutions for 3 months at -20 °C. </p><p>2. Perform serial dilution of the standard solution. Mix 200 µL of standard solution with 200 µL of diluent into a microcentrifuge tube. In the next tube, mix 100 µL of the above solution with 300 µL diluent. Again take 100 µL of the above solution and mix with 300 µL of diluent in a fresh microcentrifuge tube. In another tube, take 400 µL diluent but do not add any of the above solutions. In the end, there are four microcentrifuge tubes:</p><p>Tube #1: 0 pg/mL</p><p>Tube #2: 20 pg/mL</p><p>Tube #3: 200 pg/mL</p><p>Tube #4: 2000 pg/mL</p><p>3. Prepare 2 wells (duplicate) each for LPC, HPC, and the four standard dilutions. Ensure enough wells for all test samples. </p><p>4. First, fill all wells with 50 μL diluent.</p><p>5. Next, fill each well with 50 μL of the prepared solutions, including LPC, HPC, IFN-γ standard, and all test samples. Use the adhesive film to seal the plate. Mix the solution properly by gently tapping the plate (or putting the plate on the microwell plate shaker for 1 minute). If the room temperature is within 20-24 °C, then incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour. Else refer to figure 3 for alternative conditions for incubation. </p><p>6. Remove the adhesive film and aspirate the liquid solution from all the wells. Use manifold dispenser, multi-channel pipette, or automated washer to wash all the wells using 1X wash buffer (300 µL; four times). Remove remaining buffer by inverting and vigorously tapping the plate. After the last wash, before aspirating the remaining solution, prepare the detection solution (as mentioned in the next step) to prevent wells from drying out. </p><p>7. Dilute Streptavidin HRP and Biotin Conjugate 1:99 using conjugate diluent to prepare the detection solution. For instance, to prepare 10 mL diluent solution, add 100 µL each of Streptavidin HRP and biotin conjugate to 9.8 mL conjugate diluent. Mix the solution by inversion. </p><p>Note that, since detection solution can neither be stored nor reused, it is necessary to prepare it immediately before use. </p><p>8. Fill each well with 100 µL detection solution. Again seal the plate and incubate as described in Step",

                "body": "After final wash, before aspirating residual solution, prepare the TMB solution. </p><p>10. Aspirate the residual solution and fill each well with 100 µL TMB solution, followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature under dark.</p><p>Note: Take care of the dark condition and precise 30 minute-incubation for optimal reproducibility.</p><p>11. Fill each well with 100 µL of stop solution, which might change the color of solutions in wells from blue to yellow. </p><p>Note: Add the stop solution with the same speed and same order as the TMB solution. </p><p>12. Using absorbent paper, wipe the plate bottom to remove any foreign substance or relative humidity. Immediately measure the absorbance at 450 nm. Simultaneous read at correction wavelength of 600-650 nm is highly recommended. </p><p>Note: After addition of stop solution, the absorbance would start decreasing, due to which, it must be measured within 5 min after stop solution addition. </p><p><strong><u>Assay for IL-10 in nutshell:</u></strong></p><p>We will be using 3430-1HP-10 ELISA<sup>PRO</sup> kit ® for quantification of IL-10 in solution [27]. The kit contains: Biotinylated detection mAb (12G8); Streptavidin-HRP; Recombinant human IL-10 ELISA standard; Substrate (TMB); Buffers for washing, dilution and standard reconstitution; 2 Precoated ELISA strip plates (mAb 9D7). </p><p><strong>Protocol to be followed to measure IL-10 with the 3430-1HP-10 ELISAPRO kit ® [28]:</strong></p><p>The ELISAPRO kits contain plates that are precoated with monoclonal antibody (mAb), which captures the analyte in the sample and, on the addition of TMB substrate, changes color. The reaction is stopped by adding sulfuric acid and optical density is measured. The concentration of the analyte is determined by comparing it with a standard. The following steps are followed:</p><p>1.     The plates should be washed five times with wash buffer, and, after the final wash, we have to tap the inverted plates firmly against the absorbent paper.</p><p>2.     We then have to add 2-fold diluted blood plasma samples, assay background control (100 microL/well), and standard, and then we have to mix by tapping the plates. The plate is then covered by a plate cover and incubated at room temperature for the next 2 hours.</p><p>3.     We have to repeat the stage of washing, as mentioned above.</p><p>4.     Detection antibody (100 microL/well) has to be added, and the plates covered and incubated at room temperature for another 1 hour.</p><p>5.     The washing step has to be repeated once more.</p><p>6.     Streptavidin-HRP (100 microL/well) has to be added, and plates are covered again and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then the step of washing is repeated.</p><p>7.     TRB substrate (100 microL/well) is to be added and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, keeping away from sunlight exposure.</p><p>8.     Stop solution is to be added to the wells, and then, we have to measure absorbance at 450 nm within 15 minutes with a reader. </p><p><strong>Statistical analysis to be done: </strong></p><p>We will use paired T-test to see the difference in results between baseline and after 4 weeks of Empagliflozin 25 mg treatment using SPSS analysis software. We will also do a Pearson’s Correlation test to see any baseline relation between HbA1c, EGFR, duration of diabetes, UACR value, liver enzyme parameters in Independent axis and IF-Y value (of baseline) in dependant axis. After 4 weeks we will perform a multiple regression analysis to see the factors contributing to the change in IF-Y levels. </p><p><strong>Sample size calculation:</strong></p><p>Since there had been no study on this topic till date, we can take a sample size of 30 patients in each group as a rule of thumb for this pilot study [29].</p>"
