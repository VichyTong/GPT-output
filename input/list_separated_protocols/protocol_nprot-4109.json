The ProLuCID search results were filtered using DTASelect 2.0 \\(13) with 10 ppm mass accuracy for precursor mass and a 1% FDR cutoff at the spectral level. At least two peptides were required to identify a protein and the protein-level FDR is <1%. Positive hits were primarily selected by three stringent criteria: first, for each candidate protein, at least two peptides were detected in LC-MS/MS; second, hits detected in our two control groups were discarded; third, the candidate proteins must be detected in at least two out of four repeated experiments."
