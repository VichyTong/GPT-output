In details, images were acquired by an Andor Dragonfly 502 spinning-disc confocal microscope equipped with a 63×, 1.40 N.A. oil objective (Leica HC PL APO), a scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera (Andor Zyla 4.2), and 488-nm (mG) and 568-nm (mT) lines of the Andor Integrated Laser Engine (ILE) system with a spinning-disc confocal scan head (Andor Dragonfly 500). The oocytes were acquired through z-step mode with the index. In detail, images were acquired with laser 488-nm around 10-20%, laser 568-nm around 15-25%, exposure time 100-200 ms and Z-step 0.5-0.7 μm for 25-35 μm by Fusion 2.1 software.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://andor.oxinst.com/products/dragonfly#fusion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://andor.oxinst.com/products/dragonfly#fusion</a>).</p><p>\t (4) After acquisition, videos or single time-point images were processed by ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) for projection of all z-stacks and merged color channels. </p><p>\t(5) To finally detect the Oo-Mv on oocyte, the rotary 3D video was processed by Imaris (https://imaris.oxinst.com/) software.</p><p>\t</p><p>*Tips: The index of imaging might be changed with the situations of microscope such as the environment temperature and humidity. </p><p>\t</p>"
