    "\n<p><strong><u>1) Human iPSC culture (feeder-free)</u></strong></p><p>The here described induction and differentiation conditions are based on the feeder-free attachment (2D) culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 201B7<sup>7 </sup>and 1231A3<sup>8 </sup>on laminin-coated (iMatrix-511 silk, Nippi) sterile cell culture dishes with StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N (Reprocell) being the iPSC-culture and maintenance medium of choice. Stable culture of fully reprogramed high-quality human iPSCs is necessary for subsequent successful differentiation steps and efficient induction of mesodermal cell types described in this protocol exchange.

See Table 4 for details. Usually a master mix of the required induction medium is made and distributed into each well or dish as needed to reduce pipetting errors and well-to-well variability.</p><p>2.     Prior to induction of PS cells, iPSCs are cultured in humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator on laminin-coated plates for 5 days from initial seeding of iPSCs at single cell level. At time of induction clear epithelial colonies of iPSCs have formed and are visible under the microscope.

Following the 24 hours of initial PS induction, induce PSM cells by simultaneous activation of WNT and FGF signaling and inhibition of TGFβ and BMP signaling pathways. </p><p>1.     Prepare PSM induction medium by adding CHIR99021 (3 µM), LDN193189 (250 nM), rh-bFGF (20 ng/ml) and SB431542 (10 µM) to CDM. See Table 5 for details on components of the PSM induction medium.

For details on measurement and visualization of oscillatory expression of segmentation clock genes in <em>in vitro </em>induced human PSM cells see our concurrent paper in Nature and related recent papers by other groups<sup>2</sup>. In case of bioluminescent measurement of oscillatory gene activity, <em>in vitro </em>induced PSM cells derived from a luciferase-reporter line of e.g. human <em>HES7 </em>are cultured in CDM-based PSM medium containing D-luciferin (BMS). The presence of bioluminescent activity is measured using a luminometer set-up which allows extended culture of PSM cells <em>in vitro </em>(Atto). The here described PSM induction approach can also be used to measure and visualize oscillatory activity in other human and non-human pluripotent stem cells, but may require further adjustments and optimization of the culture conditions e.g. adjustment of the level of WNT activity during <em>in vitro </em>culture. Other human <em>in vitro </em>PSM induction protocols can also be used to characterize aspects of the <em>in vitro </em>human segmentation clock<sup>2,11</sup>. Already described in our concurrent paper<sup>1</sup>, stepwise <em>in vitro </em>induced PSM cells can be utilized for further molecular characterization and functional analysis as well as quality control e.g. RNA and protein isolation, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometric (FACS) analysis and quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR).
