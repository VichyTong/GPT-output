"\n<p>1.&nbsp;<em>Arabidopsis</em> seeds were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min, then with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution plus SDS for 9 min, and subsequently washed 6 times with autoclaved water (Fig. 1a).</p><p>2.&nbsp;Sow the seeds on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates containing 0.8% agar and 1% sucrose, and then the plates were kept in the dark for 2 days at 4 °C for stratification (Fig. 1b).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3. Seal the plates with Micropore surgical tape and put them vertically in a growth chamber with 16/8 h photoperiod at 22°C, with the light intensity of 120 mmol photons m<sup>-2 </sup>sec<sup>-1</sup>, and relative humidity of 70% for 5 days (Fig. 1c). Five-day-old seedlings with approximately 1.5-cm-long roots were used for&nbsp;the further experiments.</p><p>4. <em>Arabidopsis</em> seedlings were carefully transferred to TPG with half-strength MS nutrients containing 0.8% agar and 1% sucrose or IPG with half-strength MS nutrients containing only 0.8% agar (no sucrose). Under TPG, roots is grown in transparent Petri dishes in the presence of light and sucrose-added medium. Under IPG, roots will be grown at the black Petri dish without sucrose addition, black tapes was used in oblong hole to shut out light, and the top part of the seedlings will grow in light (out of oblong hole).</p><p>5.&nbsp;Seal the plates with Micropore surgical tape and place the plates vertically in a growth chamber at 22 °C for 10 days.</p><p>6. After 10 days, we have found that although no significant difference was found in the shoot under TPG or IPG in <em>Arabidopsis</em> ecotype Col-0 (Fig. 2a), the primary root lengths in TPG were significantly longer than that in IPG (Figs. 2b,e). Furthermore, the lateral root number, lateral root density or root hair density were substantially increased in IPG (Figs. 2c,d,f,g).The root meristem size in LGR is similar to TPG (Figs. 3a,c). However, the<strong> </strong>elongation&nbsp;zone of primary roots were increased dramatically in IPG than TPG (Figs. 3b,d). The root elongation growth is dependent on auxin-triggered acidiﬁcation of the root apoplast of <em>Arabidopsis</em>(Fig. 4).</p>"
