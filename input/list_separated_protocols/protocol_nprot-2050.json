        "body": "\\(All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals approved by University of Tokyo.) \r\n\n\n1, In NE and ISO infusion experiments, C57/B6j mice received either sham operation or implantation of subcutaneous-osmotic-mini-pump \\(Alzet). NE or ISO infused mice were randomly assigned to high salt \\(HS, 8 %) or normal chow \\(NS, 0.3 %) diet group for 2 weeks. In treatment studies, PRO, HCTZ and amiloride were given through drinking water, Epl with or without 8%HS and Olm with or without 8%HS was administered orally.\r\n\n\n2, Peform bilateral adrenalectomy through a dorsal incision under ether anesthesia. Adrenalectomized mice received 0.9% NaCl, 1% sucrose, 25μg/ml corticosterone through drink water for 2 days, then 0.9% salt drink water only during the whole experiment. \r\n\n\n3, In Dahl model, 6-week-old male Dahl-S and Dahl-R rats \\(SLC) were fed an 8 % or a 0.3 % NaCl diet for 2 or 4 weeks. In the drug treatment studies, Dahl-S rats were randomly assigned to one of the following: PRO, prazosin or Epl.\r\n\n\n4, In experiments of DOCA-salt rats, male Sprague-Dawley \\(SD) rats \\(Tokyo Laboratory Animals Science) weighing 250~270g, at 8 weeks of age were nephrectomized. Four days after the surgical removal of right kidney, rats were randomly assigned to receive DOCA or sham injection subcutaneously twice per week. At the same time they maintained on 8 % NaCl diet for 2 weeks. \r\n\n\n5, In experiment of renal denervation, rats were randomly assigned to renal denervation or sham operation every 2 weeks. Under dissecting microscope, visible renal nerves, fat and connective tissue were stripped from the renal vessels. Renal vessels were then painted with a 20% phenol in PBS solution to ensure the destruction of any remaining nerves.\r\n\n\n6, Measure renal norepinephrine turnover as described previously<sup>1</sup>. After the blockade of NE synthesis by 300 mg/kg of α-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester hydrochloride, tissue NE contents decrease exponentially in accord with the release of NE in response to incoming nerve impulses. Five or six animals from each group were sacrificed at 6hr. Their kidneys were removed for analysis of endogenous NE \\(examined by SRL, Tokyo, Japan). The rate of constant decline represents the fractional turnover rate of norepinephrine or the percentage of the pool declining per 6 hours.\r\n\n\n7, For sodium clearance by acute injection of HCTZ, lightly anesthetize each experimental rat  with ether and insert a cannula into the carotid artery, jugular vein and bladder. Three hours after recovery from anesthesia, physiological saline \\(1ml/hour) for three hours and the acute injection of HCTZ \\(2mg/kg) at time 0 were done through venous catheter; six urine were collected at 30 min intervals for 3 hours to measure urine volume and subsequently calculate urine sodium excretion \\(UNaV) and fractional urinary excretion of sodium \\(FENa); the mean arterial pressure during the whole process was monitored.. The degree of renal NCC activity was estimated by scrutinizing changes in UNa in response to HCTZ \\(ΔUNaV with HCTZ). β<sub>1</sub>AR blocker metoprolol and β<sub>2</sub>AR blocker ICI118551 were subcutaneously administered by the Alzet mini-pump. Additionally, to eliminate the effect of volume changing induced by acute HCTZ injection, acute saline injection was used to instead of HCTZ, acute injection of saline did not significantly changed sodium excretion. \r\n\n\n8, Chronic effects of ISO and HCTZ administration on UNaV and plasma volume \\(ΔPV) were also studied in rats kept on the metabolic cage. Daily dietary sodium intake and urine volume were measured every 24 hours. At the 3rd day of each administration, 100μl of blood sample were taken from every rat. Percent changes in PV were estimated by those in hematocrit \\(paired t-test).\r\n\n\n9, β<sub>1</sub>AR-/- and β<sub>2</sub>AR-/- mice was purchased from Jackson’s Lab. Distal nephron-specific GR-/- mice were generated as described previously<sup>2</sup>. Male offspring derived from each β<sub>1</sub>AR-/-, β<sub>2</sub>AR-/- mice and distal nephron-specific GR-/- mice intercrosses were analyzed in this study. The mice were treated pharmacologically as described above.\r\n\n\n●"

Mean arterial pressure of conscious mice was monitored by using the radio-telemetry system. \r\n\n\n1, Anesthetize mice with ether, and isolate the left carotid artery. \r\n\n\n2, Insert the tip of the catheter of the transmitters \\(model PA-C10) in the carotid artery and advance in the aortic arch, with the telemeter body positioned in a subcutaneous pocket on the right flank. \r\n\n\n3, After 7 days of recovery from surgery, mean artery pressure was continuously monitored using a model RPC-1 receiver, APR-1 ambient pressure monitor, and a Data Quest ART Silver 4.2 acquisition system \\(Data Sciences International). \r\n\n\n4, At 15-min intervals, the system was set to sample the mean, systolic, and diastolic arterial pressure over 15sec. and calculated their average values.
