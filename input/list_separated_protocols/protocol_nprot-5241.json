"\n1.) Place the larvae in a 1m^3 box. The box will already be pre-filled with dirt. \r\n\n\n2.) Feed the larvae the specific food described in the protocol 3-4 times a day in an interval of 2-3 hours in between. This will allow to most efficient amount of growth.\r\n\n\n3.) Continue this until the larvae become pupals. This is  \r\n\n\nthe moment when the most amount of food should be put in the box.\r\n\n\n4.)
