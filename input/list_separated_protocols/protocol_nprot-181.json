However, this statistic must be considered with caution since not all calculations were made with some of the more rigorous computational programs now available.\r\n\n\nThe crucial parameter for the initial success of the biological QSAR was the numerical value of hydrophobic interactions.<sup>9</sup> Despite the great complexity of studies of all types of chemicals reacting with various kinds of biological systems \\(from DNA to whole animals), the n-octanol/water partition coefficient used in log terms provides surprising insights. The hydrophobic parameter for the substituents \\(π) can be of great importance in delineating local hydrophobic interactions at the receptor level.<sup>4</sup> Partition coefficients are rarely measured these days because it is costlier as well as time-consuming process. In the other hand, the use of data from the literature to formulate QSAR means that the compounds are not usually available for the measurement of their partition coefficients. C-QSAR program contains 12958 QSARs in bio-database, 6953 contain log _P_ terms and 930 have π terms; hence, it is very important to have the best possible means for their calculations. There are now a variety of methods for the calculation of log _P_ .<sup>10</sup> The most extensively used method is that of Leo.<sup>10,11</sup> \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe other important parameters are steric parameters i.e. MR-SUB, CMR, MgVol, E<sub>S</sub>, _L_, B1, and B5.\r\n\n\nIn the biological QSAR log 1/C is in molar terms except in a few cases marked by log 1/C'.
