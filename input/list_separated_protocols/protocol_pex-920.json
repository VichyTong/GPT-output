    "\n<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p><strong>Day 1</strong>:</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: this procedure has been used for cultured adherent and suspension cells as well as for Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). The cultured cells can be grown using standard conditions appropriate for particular cells lines being assayed and processed as described below starting with the “Preparation of crosslinked nuclei” section. The procedure for preparation of PBMCs is given below.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Preparation of PBMCs (optional), 1 hour: </strong></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: here and below the times in hours are approximate and given for 1-10 samples processed in parallel.</p><p>1. Collect 2-4 ml of peripheral blood in EDTA anti-coagulation tubes and mix well by gently inverting the tube several times. Keep on ice and process as soon as possible. Do not freeze.</p><p>2. Dilute the samples with equal volume of 1× PBS at room temperature.</p><p>3. Take several of the Solarbio Lymphocyte Separation Medium into a 15 ml centrifuge tube (add 3 ml when the volume of the diluted blood is less than 3 ml, add equal volume of Solarbio Lymphocyte Separation Medium when the volume of the diluted blood is more than 3 ml).</p><p>4. Gently layer the diluted blood on the top of Solarbio Lymphocyte Separation Medium. The layering should be done very slowly that diluted blood and Solarbio Lymphocyte Separation Medium should stay as two different layers.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: the total volume of diluted blood and Solarbio Lymphocyte Separation Medium shouldn’t more than 10 ml, otherwise the separation will be affected. Make sure that the samples are at room temperature before proceeding to the next step.</p><p>5. Centrifuge the samples for 30 min at 1000g at 25°C in the 5804R centrifuge with acceleration and brake settings of 6 and 0 respectively.</p><p>6. Carefully aspirate the PBMCs formed in the interphase into a new 15 ml tube. The cells in the interphase need to be aspirated without delay.</p><p>7. Add 10 ml of sterile 1× PBS into the tube with the aspirate, gently resuspend the aspirate and then centrifuge at 250g at 25°C for 10 min.</p><p>8. Remove the supernatant and repeat the last step.</p><p>9. After the centrifugation, resuspend the aspirate in 1-2 ml of sterile 1× PBS, count the PBMCs while keeping cells on ice and proceed to the crosslinking immediately as described in the section below at step 8.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Preparation of crosslinked nuclei, 2.5 hours:</strong></p><p>Keep samples on ice unless specified otherwise. Samples processed with high-speed refrigerated centrifuge below.</p><p>1. For non-adherent cells, proceed directly to step 5 of this procedure.</p><p>2. For adherent cells, remove the growth medium carefully and wash the cells twice with1× PBS at room temperature.</p><p>3. Clearly remove the 1× PBS and digest with trypsin until the cells detach.</p><p>4. Inactivate trypsin with the growth medium with serum.</p><p>5. Resuspend and count the cells.</p><p>6. Collect the cells, centrifuge to remove the growth medium with serum at 100 g for 5 min at 4°C.</p><p>7. Remove the supernatant, completely resuspend the cells in the fresh growth medium with serum.</p><p>8. Start with 1-3 million non-adherent or adherent cells or 4-6 million PBMCs resuspended in 1-2 ml of either the growth medium with serum or 1× PBS (PBMCs) in a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube.</p><p>9. Add 27 µl of 37% formaldehyde per 1 ml of cell culture medium or PBS while slowly shaking the cells for 10 min at room temperature. The final concentration of formaldehyde is 1%.</p><p>10. Add 100 µl of 1.375 M glycine (final concentration 0.125 M) per milliliter to quench formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Gently pipette with tip and invert several times with the tube to mix them well.</p><p>11. Centrifuge the cells at 220 g for 10 min at 4°C.</p><p>12. Remove the supernatant and wash the cells twice with 2 ml of cold 1× PBS at 220 g for 10 min at 4°C.</p><p>13. Carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 ml of cold cell lysis buffer.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: the pelleted cells would stick to each other after adding the cell lysis buffer, therefore pipette with up and down to separate them completely. Setting the volume to one third of the pipette range can effectively avoid the pellet loss.</p><p>14. Incubate for 10 min on ice.</p><p>15. After the lysis, centrifuge the nuclei at 300 g in a benchtop centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C.</p><p>16. Aspirate the supernatant carefully.</p><p>17. Wash the pellet with 500 µl cold 1× MNase buffer, centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C at 300 g.</p><p>18. Repeat steps 16-17 and remove the supernatant.</p><p>19. At this step, the nuclei can be stored at -80°C for up to one month. If this is desirable, resuspend the pellet by adding 100 µl 1× MNase buffer and move the samples directly into -80°C. When ready to proceed, thaw them on the ice around 5 min until completely thawed, centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C at 300 g, remove the supernatant and proceed to the sections below. If storage is not necessary, proceed with the nuclear pellet directly to the sections below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SDS permeabilization (optional), 2 hours:</strong></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: this step is only necessary if nuclei are to be treated with enzymes that cannot easily diffuse into the nuclei (having molecular weight &gt;30 kDa) as shown in the example below for the treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) that can make breaks with 3’-phosphate termini detectable in the SSiNGLe procedure. If no such treatments are necessary then proceed directly to the section “MNase fragmentation and DNA purification”.</p><p>1. Resuspend the pellet completely in 100 µl of 1× MNase buffer and transfer the sample to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.</p><p>2. Add 3 µl of 10% SDS into the tube, gently pipette up and down while moving around the tip to mix the SDS well, the final concentration of SDS is 0.3%. Slowly shake (300 rpm) at 37°C for 1h in the thermostatic metal bath.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: the nuclei would stick to the pipette tip at the following step easily, therefore use ultra-low attachment tip and pipette gently to avoid loss.</p><p>3. Slowly add 1.8 µl of Triton X-100 into the solution, gently pipette up and down while moving around the tip to mix Triton X-100 well, the final concentration of Triton X-100 is 1.8%. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature to sequester SDS.</p><p>4. Centrifuge 15 min at 1500 g with the temperature setting of 27°C in a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge.</p><p>5. Aspirate the supernatant carefully and completely. Wash the pellet with 500 µl of 1× MNase buffer, centrifuge 15 min at 1500 g with the temperature setting of 27°C in a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: prolong the centrifugation time if complete precipitation is not achieved initially.</p><p>6. Repeat step 5.</p><p>7. Aspirate the supernatant carefully and use the nuclei for the following step.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Treatment with SAP (optional), 3.5 hours:</strong></p><p>1. Wash the permeabilized nuclei with 500 µl of 1× NEB buffer 2.1, gently resuspend the permeabilized nuclei and centrifuge at 1500 g with the temperature setting of 27°C in a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge for 10 min.</p><p>2. Carefully remove the supernatant and repeat step 1.</p><p>3. Remove the supernatant, resuspend the nuclei in 50 µl of 1× NEB buffer 2.1.</p><p>4.

We have so far successfully sequenced these libraries on the HiSeq X Ten or NovaSeq platforms using the paired-end 150 bp strategy.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Processing of the Illumina reads and extracting the coordinates of breaks:</strong></p><p>1. Filter the reads such that each read has Phred quality score >20 and length >30:</p><p> </p><p>fastq_quality_trimmer -v -t 20 -l 30 -i read_1.clean.fq -o read_1.clean.fq.1 -Q33;</p><p>fastq_quality_trimmer -v -t 20 -l 30 -i read_2.clean.fq -o read_2.clean.fq.1 -Q33;</p><p> </p><p>2. Select read pairs where reads 1 start with 10 G’s or AGTTGCGGATGGGGGGGGGG in the NovaSeq protocol and reads 2 start with 12T’s.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: the selection criteria could be relaxed to include reads starting with 9-11G’s and reads 2 starting with 11-13 T’s by selecting reads starting with the desired sequences and then merging the filtering results. For example, the data below were filtered for 10 G’s and 12 T’s (2.1) or AGTTGCGGATGGGGGGGGGG and 12 T’s (2.2). The data can also be for example selected for reads starting with 9 G’s and 12 T’s, 10 G’s and 12 T’s, 11 G’s and 12 T’s and so on and merged together.</p><p> </p><p>(2.1) perl 1_filter_paired.flags.pl read_1.clean.fq.1 read_2.clean.fq.1 GGGGGGGGGG TTTTTTTTTTTT</p><p> </p><p>(2.2) perl 1_filter_paired.flags.pl read_1.clean.fq.1 read_2.clean.fq.1 AGTTGCGGATGGGGGGGGGG TTTTTTTTTTTT</p><p> </p><p>3. Map the reads to the desired reference genome, which should be downloaded in advance, for example the human GRCh37/hg19 assembly (Human19.fasta) downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (<a href=\"http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/</a>).</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: to determine a profile of mitochondrial breaks, we align reads to the chrM genome separately and use the same downstream analysis steps below.</p><p> </p><p>Build the genome index:</p><p> </p><p>bwa index Human19.fasta –p HG19</p><p> </p><p>Map the reads:</p><p> </p><p>bwa mem –t 8 -M -R '@RG\\tID:foo\\tSM:bar\\tLB:library1' HG19 read_1.clean.fq.1.trim read_2.clean.fq.1.trim > read.sam</p><p> </p><p>4. Filter the alignments by extracting only unique and proper mapped paired reads, and then extract the alignment records of reads 2 containing the coordinates of breaks:</p><p> </p><p>perl 3_filter.sam.pl read.sam >read.proper.sam 2>log.3</p><p> </p><p>5. Convert the SAM file to a BED file and then extract the very first position of each aligned record of reads 2:</p><p> </p><p>sh 4_sam2bed.right.proper.sh read.proper.sam read.candidates.bed 2>log.4</p><p> </p><p>6. Filter the alignments based on the fraction of T’s in the 20-base genomic sequence 5′ upstream of the reads 2 alignments:</p><p> </p><p>perl 5_filtering.internal.polyA.pl read.candidates.bed Human19.fasta 20 0.4 >read.bed 3>log.5</p><p> </p><p>7. Extract the coordinates of breaks:</p><p> </p><p>cat read.bed | awk ‘$6 == “+”’ | awk '{print $1\"\\t\"$2\"\\t\"$2+1\"\\t\"$4\"\\t\"$5\"\\t-\"}' >read.break.bed.minus</p><p>cat read.bed | awk ‘$6 == “-”’ | awk '{print $1\"\\t\"$2\"\\t\"$2+1\"\\t\"$4\"\\t\"$5\"\\t+\"}' >read.break.bed.plus</p><p>cat read.break.bed.plus read.break.bed.minus | sort –k1,1 –k2n,2 >read.break.bed</p><p>rm –f read.break.bed.minus read.break.bed.plus</p>"
