A gap is defined as missing biochemical information which can explain discrepancies between model predictions and experimental data. Gaps are typically reactions that facilitate the conversion of an available metabolite in the model to one necessary to achieve an objective. Identifying gaps in metabolic models can be attempted using either \\(A) detectDeadEnds or \\(B) gapFind.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(A) Detect Dead Ends in a Model\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n>> outputMets = detectDeadEnds\\(_model,\\[removeExternalMets]_)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe detectDeadEnds function searches the model.S matrix for metabolites that participate in only one reaction \\(can only be produced or only be consumed) and returns the corresponding indices for the metabolites in the model.mets field.

The appropriate bound magnitude required varies from model to model.
