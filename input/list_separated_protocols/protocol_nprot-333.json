Briefly, mix 50 μl of CFA with 50 μl of recombinant rat MOG \\(50 μg in PBS, corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of rat MOG) in the  eppendorf tube. Anesthetize the rats with ketamine \\(80 mg/kg)/xylazine \\(8 mg/kg) mixture, with 6-8 rats anesthesized at a time before emulsion injections. Inject the 100 µl cocktail into rat by intradermal injection at the base of the tail. \r\n\n\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Generally, excess emulsion is prepared due to loss from surface adhesion. The injection should be performed slowly, requiring about 30-60s before removing the needle. \r\n\n\n After MOG induction, determine the EAE scores for each rat using the following system: grade 0.5, distal paresis of the tail; grade 1, complete tail paralysis; grade 1.5, paresis of the tail and mild hind leg paresis; grade 2.0, unilateral severe hind leg paresis; grade 2.5, bilateral severe hind limb paresis; grade 3.0, complete bilateral hind limb paralysis; grade 3.5, complete bilateral hind limb paralysis and paresis of one front limb; grade 4, complete paralysis \\(tetraplegia), moribund state, or death. Generally the induced EAE rats are required to be killed when their body weight loss exceeds 1/3 of initial body weight or severe clinical signs occur \\(EAE score ≧3.5). It is difficult to study animals that followed a progressive EAE course for more than 60 days because these animals developed considerable loss of body weight and other complications. The EAE animals survived for 35 days in our study.\r\n\n\n▲ CRITICAL STEP Special attention on food, water and urination should be paid once rats have clinical symptoms of EAE. Clinical signs of EAE usually begin between 9 and 20 days post-immunization."
