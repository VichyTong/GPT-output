In the microtubule case, if you annotate the spacing between microtubules, instead of the microtubules themselves \\(it is actually quite easy to make such mistake when annotating microtubule bundles), the neural network can behave unpredictably and sometimes just refuse to segment anything. Here is the training result on an incorrect and correct segmentation in one training set. Note the top one \\(22) is annotating the space between microtubules. \r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5831/original/goodvsbadseg.png\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n• Make sure there are no positive samples in the negative training set. If your target feature is everywhere and it is hard to find negative regions, you can add additional positive samples which include various features other than the target feature \\(annotating only the target feature). \r\n\n\n• You can bin your tomogram differently to segment different features. Just import multiple copies of raw tomogram with different shrink factors, and unbin the segmentation using math.fft.resample processor. It is particularly useful when you have features with different lengthscales in one tomogram, and it is impossible to both fit the large features into a 64*64 box and still have the smaller features visible at the same scale. \r\n\n\n• In some cases, there is a significant missing wedge in the x-y plane slices \\(you can visualize this by clicking Amp button when looking at the slices in EMAN2). So the resolvability on x direction is different than that on y direction. It is important to provide features running in different directions in the training set, otherwise the neural net may only pick up features in one direction based on the Fourier patten. Also, you may want to check the stage of the microscope, since this may suggest the sample is not tilted exactly around the x axis. \r\n\n\n• It is also vital to cover various states of the target feature. For example, if you want to segment single layer membranes, you may want to have some cell membrane, some small vesicles, and some vesicles with darker density inside, so the neural network can grab the concept of membrane. Just imagine how you would teach someone with no biological knowledge about the features you are looking for. On the other hand, it is possible to ask the neural network to separate different types of those same features. In the membrane example, it is possible to train the neural network to segment vesicles from cell membranes based on the curvature, or recognize dense vesicles based on the difference of intensity on both side of the membrane, given carefully picked training set."
