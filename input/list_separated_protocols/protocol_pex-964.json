Prime the LS columns by rinsing with 3 mL of MACS buffer and discarding the effluent. Apply the cell suspension onto the LS column and collect the flow-through containing the unlabeled cells (CD34<sup>−</sup> cells). </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash the LS column three times with 3 mL of MACS buffer, adding new buffer only when the column reservoir is empty. Collect unlabeled cells that pass through (CD34<sup>-</sup> cells).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the column from the separator and place it over a new collection tube. Pipette 5 mL of EGM-2 medium onto the LS column and immediately flush out the magnetically labeled cells (CD34<sup>+</sup> cells) by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the purity of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, the eluted fraction is enriched over a second MS column. Repeat the magnetic separation procedure by using a MS column. MS column needs to be primed with 500 μL of MACS buffer and wash 3 times with 500 μL of MACS buffer.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After CD34<sup>+</sup> cells collection from the MS column, resuspend in 1 mL of EGM-2 medium, and count the purified CD34<sup>+</sup> fraction using a hemocytometer. </p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plate CD34<sup>+</sup> cells at a density of 3´10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on 24 well plates coated with 0.1% gelatin in the presence of endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM-2, Lonza) supplemented with PDGF<sub>BB</sub> (50 ng/mL, Peprotech). </p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the medium 24 h after cell seeding, and then every other day. </p><p><br></p><p><u>Passage of iPSC-derived SMCs</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passage the cells when they reach confluency.
