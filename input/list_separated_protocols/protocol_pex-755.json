"\n<p>All donated embryos in this study were surplus frozen embryos from couples who already had at least a healthy baby after IVF clinic treatment. The informed consent process for embryo donation compiled with International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation (2016) and Ethical Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell research (2003) jointly issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health of People’s Republic of China.</p><p><strong>Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before embryo thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 was equilibrated in a</p><p>4-well plate overnight. 0.5 ml of G-2 medium was added to the well, and then 0.25 ml of mineral oil was used to cover the G2 medium.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The G-2 medium must be pre-equilibrated in the incubator overnight or for at least 6 hours.</p><p>2. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post-fertilization, d.p.f 5-6) were thawed using a Kitazato Thawing Media Kit by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>3. After culturing in drops of equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, the embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution to remove the zona pellucida.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Pasteur's pipette diameter should be larger than the embryo diameter to avoid damaging the embryos. No more than two embryos were treated in the acidic Tyrode’s solution each time. Once the zona pellucida vanished, the embryos were immediately transferred to G-2 medium to avoid damage to the embryos by the acidic Tyrode’s solution.</p><p>4. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium for two times and then transferred to <em>in vitro </em>culture medium.</p><p><strong>Evaluation of embryo quality </strong></p><p>According to the Gardner’s scoring system<sup>6</sup>, thawed blastocysts were given numerical scores from 1 to 6 based on their expansion degree and hatching status. The blastocyst with expansion and hatching status above 3 and with visible inner cell mass above grade B were included in the study. Based on morphologies, normal embryos had to meet the two following requirements: obvious expansion during culturing and absence of obviously dead or broken (fragmented) cell mass during development. Otherwise, they were excluded in this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>In vitro</em> three-dimensional culture of human embryos</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture conditions were as follows: 37.2℃, 6% CO<sub>2</sub> and saturated humidity</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150 µL/well mIVC1 was added to a low-attachment 96-well plate (3474, Corning) and the culture medium was pre-equilibrated for at least six hours</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day 5-6 embryos without zona pellucida were washed in pre- equilibrated mIVC1 three times and then transferred to a new well for each embryo</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Embryos should be washed at least 3 times in mIVC1 to remove the G-2 residue.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On day 6-8 post-fertilization (d.p.f 6-8), the culture medium was<em> </em>mIVC1</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At d.p.f 8, 50% of mIVC1 medium was replaced by mIVC2</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At d.p.f 9, the embryos were transferred to new wells in mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Matrigel should be thawed at 4℃, and all operations should be performed on ice.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, 50% of the culture medium was replaced with new mIVC2 including 10% Matrigel every day.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The time that the embryos are outside of the incubator should be minimized when replacing medium or taking photos. mIVC1 and mIVC2 should be pre-equilibrated in the incubator for at least six hours before use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Embryo frozen
