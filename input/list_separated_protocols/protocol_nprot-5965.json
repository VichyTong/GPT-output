We use the RF plasma generated over a Si target in an Angstrom Engineering Nextdep sputter machine with a target to sample distance of 10 cm, with the following parameters: Power: 15 W; duration: 30 s; process pressure: 3 mtorr; process gas flows: 20 sccm O<sub>2</sub> and 5 sccm Ar."

If more space is needed for one sample group, the inner silicone wall of 2x2 wells can be cut away before mounting the silicone chamber onto the surface of the micro-cavity chip forming an area of 1.60 x 1.60 cm<sup>2</sup>."

When removing the suspension or washing the chip, care needs to be taken, that the surface of the micro-cavity is always covered with liquid, as the large surface tensions generated when drying-out would case the micro-cavity to crack. Therefore, never completely remove the solution from the silicone well but wash several times with the new solution if the medium needs to be changed."
