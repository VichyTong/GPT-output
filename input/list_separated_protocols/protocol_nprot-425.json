Recently we have found that egg chambers survive and border cells migrate at 25°C, but when put at 4°C, they retract protrusions \\(M.M. and D.J.M., unpublished).  We do not know if gene expression patterns are altered as a function of temperature but it may be just as good, or even better, to keep the egg chambers at room temperature during the dissection, rather than putting them on ice.  This needs to be determined empirically."

For our initial large scale experiments, 5 μg of each RNA from _slbo_-Gal4/UAS-mCD8-GFP and UAS-mCD8-GFP / +; _tub_-Gal4/+ flies was used to make cRNA probes following Affymetrix probe labeling instruction \\( \"http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx\":http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx). However, we also had success with small scale experiments, which require much less starting tissue.  30 ovary pairs are sufficient to yield more than 100ng of RNA. For this strategy, isolate 100ng of each RNA from UAS-mCD8-GFP /+; c522/+ and _slbo_-Gal4/UAS-mCD8-GFP and UAS-mCD8-GFP / +; _tub_-Gal4/+ flies  to make cRNA probes by following the protocol Small Sample Target Labeling Assay Version II \\( \"http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx\":http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx).  Briefly, synthesize double-stranded cDNA using Invitrogen Superscript II, then amplify the cRNA pool with the Ambion MEGAScript T7 kit and a second round of cDNA synthesis.  Amplify and label the cRNA using the ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript labeling kit.  Hybridize cRNA probes to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array as directed, then wash and proceed to signal detection as suggested by Affymetrix.

In addition, by crossing the GAL4 driver of interest and UAS-mCD8-GFP in mutant backgrounds, the same population of cells can be purified from wild-type and mutant strains.  For example, to identify transcriptional targets of the Slow Border Cells \\(SLBO) transcription factor, one can isolate border cells from _slbo_-Gal4, _slbo<sup>e7b</sup>_ / UAS-mCD8-GFP, _slbo<sup>Ly6</sup>_ flies to compare these loss-of-function mutants to wild type.  As the _slbo_-Gal4 driver also activates expression in the centripetal cells, a different driver may be needed.  We used c522, _slbo<sup>e7b</sup>_ / UAS-mCD8-GFP, _slbo<sup>Ly6</sup>_ to identify SLBO targets that might be specific to the border cells.  As we expected, this method uncovered some known and many new potential target genes for SLBO.  In a similar type of experiment, we sought to identify targets of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.  In this case, we used _slbo_-Gal4, UAS-mCD8-GFP / UAS-UPD because high levels of the activating protein Unpaired \\(UPD) result in hyper-activation of STAT target genes."
