Note: the number of samples does not correspond to the number of wells and does not include controls. Samples are tested in duplicates; therefore, one sample corresponds to two wells. For example, the number of samples to be inserted is 4 for the plate of 12 wells presented in \"Figure 3\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6429/original/Figure3.pdf?1518707963.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n81 Select the “Kit Information” tab.
