The latter approach is used for semi-quantitative expression of phenotypic markers with a unimodal distribution. Three-color flow cytometry panels optimized for use in dogs were employed to characterize mononuclear cells phenotypically in colon biopsies, on the basis of the mean fluorescence intensity and frequency. The analysis of cells should focus on the composition of the sub-populations. The cells surveyed were: CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, FOXP3<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>, TLR9<sup>+</sup>, TLR2<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup> and mannose<sup>+</sup>. This provides an opportunity to compare the mucosa of dogs with various clinical states of leishmaniasis."
