            "The Au/Fe nanoparticles were first synthesized by preparing Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> seeds using modified co-precipitation method<sup>20</sup> which were further oxidized to encapsulate with Au shells. Various parameters such as Au/Fe salt concentration and time kinetics of the reaction were optimized to have monodispersed nanoparticles. These gold coated iron oxide particles were separated out from the solutions by using a lab magnet \\(10 Tesla). High resolution transmission electron microscopy \\(HR-TEM) was carried out to characterize the surface morphology and elemental mapping of synthesized nanobioprobes. The line mapping and elemental composition studies of the selected nanoparticles confirmed the formation of Fe core and Au shell as single Au/Fe nanostructure \\(Fig.",

The ionic strength of antibody solution was kept minimum \\(10 mM) since the increase in ionic strength effects the reduction of the thickness of the electric double layer over charged surfaces, thus decreasing the electrostatic interactions between antibodies and nanoparticles accompanied by coagulation<sup>21</sup>. The minimum amount of protein required to stabilize the nanoparticles was optimized by employing flocculation assay<sup>22</sup>. The concentration of protein has a marked tendency for flocculation of nanoparticles in solution.  A flocculation assay was designed by taking different concentrations of antibody solutions \\(0.1–1 mg/ml). 100 μl of each dilution was added to 1 ml of as prepared Au/Fe nanoparticles. After 15 min, flocculation was induced by adding 100 μl of 10% NaCl and absorbance was measured at 580 nm. The characterization of nanobioprobes was done with Dynamic light scattering \\(DLS), Transmission electron microscopy \\(TEM), Atomic force microscopy \\(AFM) and Superconducting quantum interference device \\(SQUID) \\(Supplementary Fig. S1 and S2). A fully optimized protocol, both for the Au/Fe nanoparticles synthesis and their functionalization with specific antibodies was developed in this study."
