Store the cytokines in a refrigerator at - 80°C, except that insulin is stored at 4°C. Store other dissolved reagents in a refrigerator at - 20°C. Reagents are stored in small quantity to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. The thawed reagents can be stored at 4°C for no more than 2 weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Preparation of xeno-free human EPS cell medium</u></p><p>1. Thaw packed stock solutions at room temperature.</p><p>2. For preparing 50 ml xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium, add the reagents according to the information shown below:</p><p>DMEM/F12 (liquid) 25 ml, Neurobasal (liquid) 25 ml, Insulin 50 μl, Apo-transferrin 5.5 μl, Sodium selenite</p><p>5 μl, L-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate 100 μl, Activin A 10 μl (20 ng/ml), Human LIF 5 μl, CHIR99021 5 μl, (S)-(+)-Dimethindene maleate 5 μl, Minocycline Hydrochloride 5 μl, Y-27632 2.5 μl, Ethanolamine (liquid) 2.5 μl, Catalase (liquid) 10 μl.</p><p>3. Prepared xeno-free hEPS medium could be kept at 4°C for up to 1 week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Preparation of LN-521 coated plates</u></p><p>Thaw 1 vial of LN-521 (100 μg/ml) at 4°C. Prepare the LN-521 solution (1:40) in DPBS with calcium and magnesium. Add the solution into the wells (for a 24-well plate: 350 μl per well; for a 12-well plate: 700 μl per well). Incubate the coated plates 37°C for at least 2 hours. Alternatively, the coated plates could be placed at 4°C overnight. Do not allow the culture surface to dry as the matrix will become inactivated. The coated plates should be used as soon as possible and stored at 4°C for no more than one week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Culture and passaging of xeno-free human EPS cells</u></p><p>1. Warm the xeno-free hEPS medium at room temperature and TrypLE Select at 37°C.</p><p>2. Dilute TrypLE Select with DPBS with a 1:1 ratio. Keep the diluted TrypLE Select warm at 37°C.</p><p>3. Change the culture medium every 2-3 days. To change the medium, remove the supernatant and add fresh xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium. Passage xeno-free human EPS cells every 3-4 days.</p><p>4. Cell passaging is conducted when xeno-free human EPS cells reach 85%-95% of confluence. Wash xeno-free human EPS cells with DPBS without calcium and magnesium for once. After aspirating the DPBS solution, add 0.5X TrypLE Select solution (for a 12-well plate: about 500 μl per well) and incubate the cells at 37°C for 3 min in the incubator.</p><p>5. Remove the 0.5X TrypLE Select solution and add xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium into the well (for a 12-well plate: 1 ml per well). Pipet the digested cells into single cells and centrifuge at room temperature. Aspirate the suspension and resuspend the cells using xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium.</p><p>6. Remove the LN-521 solution from the LN-521 coated plate and add xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium (for a 12-well plate, 1 ml culturing medium). Seed the cells into the new wells at the density of 20,000-30,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>7. Change the culturing medium the next day. When the density of the seeded cells exceeds 50,000 cells/cm2, the medium needs to be changed every day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Adaptation of feeder-cultured human EPS cells to xeno-free culture system</u></p><p>1. Warm the medium and TrypLE Select at room temperature.</p><p>2. Remove the supernatant of feeder-cultured human EPS cells, wash once with DPBS, dissociate the cells with 0.5X TrypLE Select.</p><p>3. Centrifuge the cells and resuspend them with N2B27-LCDM medium (culturing medium for feeder cultured human EPS cells), and seed the cells onto the LN-521 coated plates at desired densities. The ratio is usually from 1:6 to 1:10.</p><p>4. Replace the medium with xeno-free hEPS medium 24 hours later.</p><p>5. For the first 3-5 passages, lower the split ratio (1:3) so that cell viability could be improved. The density of the seeded cells is about 40,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, 1%-5% of xeno-free KSR is recommended to be added during the adaptation so that cell viability and proliferation could be improved.</p><p>6. After 5-7 passages, the cells could proliferate well in xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Deriving xeno-free human EPS cells from Human fetal fibroblast (HFF) </u></p><p>1. Perform sendai virus transduction (CytoTuneTM-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit ) according to the user’s manual.</p><p>2. 5-7 days post transduction, replate the infected HFFs onto LN-521 coated 6-well plates at the density of 1*10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>3. Replace the cultured medium with xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium plus 5% xeno-free KSR. Change the medium every 3 days.</p><p>4. 14 days post transduction, human EPS cell-like colonies emerge. Picked up the colonies. Dissociate the colonies into single cell using TrypLE Select.</p><p>5. After 4-7 days, colonies could be visually observed. After 3-5 passages, xeno-free human EPS cell lines can be stably maintained in xeno-free human EPS cell culturing medium without KSR.</p>"
