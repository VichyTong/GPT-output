    "\nCore inoFISH protocol\r\n\n\nThis is the basic inoFISH protocol used in several steps of the experimental procedure, below. This protocol is consistent with our in-house inoFISH protocol, available in this Google Doc, which we will continuously update as we tweak experimental conditions as we find them to be useful:  https://goo.gl/ujxex1 . The procedure as of May 3, 2017, used for inoFISH experiments in the publication associated with this protocol, is as follows:\r\n\n\nPre-inoFISH\r\n\n\nCell fixation\r\n\n\nNOTE: All steps should be done in chemical hood with ventilation.\r\n\n\nTime required: Fixation: 15 minutes; Permeabilization: at least 1 hour.\r\n\n\nFor multi-chambered slides \\(cultured cells):",

All image inspection and spot calling is conducted entirely in the rajlabimagetools software package. We strongly recommend familiarizing oneself with this software and its use in simpler smFISH experiments prior to starting an inoFISH experiment: https://bitbucket.org/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki/workedExample .\r\n\n\nThe full documentation wiki for rajlabimagetools is here: https://bitbucket.org/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki/browse/ . The SNP FISH analysis pipeline guide is here, and it is directly compatible with inoFISH guide-detection probe colocalization analyses: https://bitbucket.org/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki/SNPFISH%20Colocalization%20Us er%20Guide .\r\n\n\nPlease see the rajlabimagetools wiki for a complete description of how to organize your image files and load them into rajlabimagetools.
