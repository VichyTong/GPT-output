"\n- Wash crystal quartzes three times with ethanol,\r\n\n\n- dry them with Argon,\r\n\n\n- incubate them over night at 4°C with 2 mM cysteamine,\r\n\n\n- wash quartzes again three times with ethanol to remove any unbound cysteamine,\r\n\n\n- dry quartzes with Argon\r\n\n\n- transform plasmids DNA coding for GST tagged proteins into Escherichia coli,\r\n\n\n- purify DNA using the NucleoPrepII anion exchange resin \\(Macherey Nagel),\r\n\n\n- prepare NAPPA printing mix with 1.4 μg/ul DNA, 3.75 μg/ul BSA \\(Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM BS3 \\(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and 66.5 μg polyclonal capture GST antibody \\(GE Healthcares),\r\n\n\n- prepare negative controls, named master mix \\(hereinafter abbreviated as “MM”), replacing DNA for water in the printing mix,\r\n\n\n- incubate samples at room temperature for 1 hour with agitation,\r\n\n\n- print them on the cysteamine-coated gold quartz using the Qarray II from Genetix,\r\n\n\n- perform in vitro transcription and translation \\(IVTT) using HeLa lysate mix \\(1-Step Human Coupled IVTT Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), according to the manufacturers’ instructions,\r\n\n\n- incubate the quartz, connected to the nanogravimeter inside the incubator, for 10 min at 30°C with 40 μl of HeLa lysate mix for proteins synthesis,\r\n\n\n- acquire the conductance curve \\(“IVTT addition curve”, prior protein expression),\r\n\n\n- decrease the temperature to 15°C for a period of 5-10 min to facilitate the proteins binding on the capture antibody \\(anti-GST),\r\n\n\n- acquire the conductance curve \\(“IVTT addition at 10 min”, after protein expression),\r\n\n\n- after the protein expression and capture, remove the quartzes from the instrument and wash at room temperature, in 500 mM NaCl PBS for 3 times,\r\n\n\n- after protein expression, capture, wash the quartzes in PBS at increasing concentrations at 22°C,\r\n\n\n- acquire the conductance curve \\(“Post-wash curve”, after the final washing process with PBS)."
