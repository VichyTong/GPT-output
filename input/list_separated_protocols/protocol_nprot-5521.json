CLSM and other fluorescent microscopic techniques allow the use of specific fluorophores to demonstrate bacterial presence and prevalence of specific bacterial strains, possible membrane damage \\(viability) after antibiotic treatment, presence of eDNA and other EPS components in CDFF grown biofilms<sup>12,13</sup> and last but not least, verify their thickness. However, fluorophores do not necessarily penetrate through the entire thickness of a biofilm, which limits the use of fluorescent techniques. Also laser light does not necessarily penetrate through an entire biofilm, which can be improved by using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy<sup>14</sup>. \r\n\n\nCLSM after application of appropriate fluorophores, in combination with the software program COMSTAT<sup>15</sup> is a common method to measure biofilm thickness, but a single image usually covers only a small area \\(0.00023 - 0.0056 cm<sup>2</sup>). Because of the limited penetration of fluorophores and laser light, CLSM will underestimate biofilm thickness for thicker biofilms as compared with other methods. Moreover, the small areas covered per image make it impossible to verify constant thickness over the entire area of a biofilm grown. Low-load compression testing \\(LLCT) is another technique with which biofilm thickness can be determined<sup>16</sup> and over a larger area than with CLSM \\(0.049-0.57 cm<sup>2</sup>). Like CLSM, LLCT irreversibly changes the biofilm rendering them useless for further analysis. Recently, optical coherence tomography \\(OCT) has been introduced to visualize biofilms in their hydrated state, non-destructively and in real-time over a large area \\(up to several cm2), albeit with limited resolution<sup>17</sup>. 3D images obtained from the OCT can be analyzed using a custom LabVIEW script, allowing calculation of the average biofilm thickness.
