In the event that you have &lt;30 minutes to recharge, recharge periodically when possible while remembering to disconnect the charging cable between measurements.</p><p>10. When taking samples out of an incubator to run TEER with intent to keep the samples, prepare and measure smaller groups of Transwell inserts at a time so that measured samples can be aspirated and replaced into the controlled environment of the incubator more quickly. For endpoint measurements where cells will not be kept, working quickly but with larger groups of Transwell inserts is acceptable.</p><p>11. Read the Tergazyme SDS sheet prior to cleaning the EndOhm chamber and wear protective gloves, protective clothing, eye protection, and face protection while cleaning the EndOhm chamber.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><u>Instrument set-up</u></em></p><p>1. Ensure that the EVOM2 unit is fully charged.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Plug the EVOM2 unit into an electrical outlet for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight, before beginning your TEER assay.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Taking TEER measurements while the EVOM2 unit is plugged into an electrical outlet can increase variability in your samples.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Assemble the EndOhm cup with a representative cell culture insert to confirm that the height of the electrode is 1-2 mm above the surface of the insert membrane.&nbsp;If necessary, adjust the electrode height by loosening the locking nut, turning the electrode clockwise or counterclockwise to lower or raise the electrode, respectively, and re-tightening the locking nut (Figure",
