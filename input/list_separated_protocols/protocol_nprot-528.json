In this alignment protocol we assume that the visible laser is well aligned and can be used as a guide beam. We assume that the NIR beam is steered into the microscope with two independent, adjustable mirrors \\(see Figure 2a). The mirrors allow moving the laser beam up-and-down and left-to-right.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe use these two mirrors to move the NIR beam until it is parallel to and overlaps with the visible laser beam in the sample. We use the back-aperture and the focal plane of the objective as alignment points \\(see Figure 2)."
