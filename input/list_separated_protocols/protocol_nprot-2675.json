The megablast search parameters are the following: automatically adjust parameters for short input sequences; expect threshold=10; max matches in a query range=0; match/mismatch scores=1,-2; gap cost=linear; word size=256 and without filters or repeat masking. The output of the megablast searches should appear ordered by chromosomes and by degree of score. Download the alignments as a Hit Table \\(text) and count the sequences with the highest evalues, which make perfect matches with the search sequences, using Microsoft Word. If the megablast search is performed with a sequence that contains four perfect tandem telomeric repeats, an specific ITS containing five perfect tandem repeats will reveal two overlapping sequences in the output and so on.

Check the quality of the results by standard methods. Previously published ChIP-seq experiments can also be used to analyze telomeric chromatin structure. In these cases, the number of telomeric reads can easily be calculated at NCBI, using the Sequence Reads Archive software \\(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe recommend to check the suitability of the ChIP-seq experiments for telomeric chromatin structure analyses. Specific quality controls should be performed. It might happen that a ChIP-seq experiment is fine to analyze genome-wide aspects of chromatin organization but not to analyze telomeres. This is because single sequences are used for the analysis of telomeres and some bias can arise along the ChIP-seq experiments during the cloning, amplification or sequencing of the telomeric sequences. The special architecture and repetitive nature of telomeres might favour those problems. The study of ChIP-seq experiments that have been repeated at least twice, starting with different samples of the same biological source, should help in this task. If similar results are obtained in the different repetitions of the same experiment, we consider the resulting ChIP-seq data suitable for telomeric chromatin structure analyses. See troubleshooting 6-1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIf previously published ChIP-seq experiments are analyzed, we recommend calculating the percentage of four tandem telomeric repeat reads in the input samples. In addition, we also recommend to calculate the number of four tandem telomeric repeat reads versus the number of reads corresponding to another genomic sequence, also in the input samples. Both types of numbers should remain similar in different experiments. However, we would rather prefer to analyze repetitions of the same ChIP-seq experiment that had been started with different samples of the same biological source. In this way, the bias of the immunoprecipitated samples should also be controlled. See troubleshooting 6-2.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe also recommend performing telomeric analyses using more than one telomeric sequence for each ChIP-seq run, if possible. Similar results should be obtained with sequences containing different number of perfect telomeric repeats, as far as the quality of the reads is good. See troubleshooting 6-3.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep"
