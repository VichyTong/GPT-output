    "\n<p><strong>1</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare a 2% agarose solution in deionised water.&nbsp;Microwave until agarose has fully melted.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a pair of plastic gel plates, consisting of a front and back plate (Figure 1A).&nbsp;The back plate contains the buffer reservoir for electrophoresis (see Figure 1B for side-view of the plate).&nbsp;It is important that the plates originated from the same cassette, as the plastic connectors break differently when the plates were separated).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash plates with warm water (note that hot water will deform the plastic), dry with paper towels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join plates together and lay them flat on an elevated surface such as a pipette tip box (Figure 2A).&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow easy access to the gaps between the plate, without lifting them up.</p><p><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using masking tape, seal the bottom slit of the front plate.&nbsp;Fold over the ends of the tape so that it can easily be peeled off prior to electrophoresis (Figure 2B).</p><p><strong>6</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, place a second piece of masking tape near the top just under the well numbers (Figure 2C).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flip the gel cassette over and firmly pull tape around and tape on opposing plate, such that the two plates are firmly held together by the tape (Figure 2D). &nbsp;Rub fingers firmly on the tape.</p><p><strong>8</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for agarose solution to cool to approximately 80<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;Take up agarose solution with a 1&nbsp;ml pipette, avoiding intake of air bubbles.&nbsp;Place the pipette tip on the left side of the gel, and between the two plates close to the gap, as indicated in the Figure 3A.&nbsp;Slowly expel the solution in-between the gap. &nbsp;During this procedure do not lift up the cassette, instead it must be kept horizontal at all time. &nbsp;If parts of the gap are still not filled with agarose, move along the gap and inject agarose solution where needed.</p><p>Hot (80<sup>o</sup>C) agarose solution will allow it to",

on the right side of the cassette.</p><p><strong>10</strong>.     Keeping the plate in its horizontal position, repeat the same procedure, but starting from the bottom gap (Figure 3B). Since this gap is more narrow, make sure the agarose solution is still hot, to allow it to flow easily into the gap. Slowly run the pipette tip back and forth along the gap, and ensure the gap is fully filled with agarose. Pipette slowly to avoid air bubbles entering the gap. If air bubbles did enter the gap, they can be removed with an empty 200 µL tip attached to a pipette, by sucking up the air bubbles.</p><p><strong>11</strong>.     Do not lift the cassette or move it, until the agarose has solidified.</p><p><strong>12</strong>.     Place the cassette upright in a peg rack, as shown in Figure 4A. Best results are achieved when the cassette fits firmly in the rack. This will apply slight pressure on the plates, pressing them against each other, ensuring the acrylamide will not leak out.</p><p><strong>13</strong>.     Place medium sized bulldog clips on either side of the cassette as indicated in Figure 4B.</p><p><strong>14</strong>.    Keeping the cassettes in the rack, lift the rack and tilt at a 45<sup>o </sup>angle as illustrated in Figure 5A below. Take up hot agarose solution with a 1 ml pipette. Place the pipette tip on right inside edge of the cassette. Allow the agarose solution to flow down along the inside edge and to the bottom. Tilt the rack and cassette back to the horizontal position, allowing the agarose solution to continue flowing along the bottom inside edge of the cassettes. Repeat on the left side (Figure 5B). Repeat the process, until there is at least 2-3mm of agarose along the bottom inside edge of the cassettes (Figure 5C). This will require approximately 1.5 ml of agarose solution in total). Allow the agarose to set. </p><p><strong>15</strong>.     Test the sealed cassette for any potential leaks by squeezing water into the cassette using a wash bottle (Figure 6A).</p><p><strong>16</strong>.     Fill up cassette with water (Figure 6B). Leave for a few minutes to give time for the sighting of any leaks.</p><p><strong>17</strong>      After confirmation that the cassette is note leaking, discard the water by carefully inverting the rack over a sink while holding the cassette in place. Place the rack with the cassette back on the bench. Insert a strip of blotting/filter paper between the plates to remove any remaining water (Figure 6C). Several pieces of absorbent paper may be needed to remove all water. Note that stiffer absorbent paper such as Whatman paper works best.</p><p><strong>18</strong>.     The cassette is ready for pouring the SDS-PAGE gel. For pouring a gradient gel see reference (1). Cassettes will generally require 15mls of acrylamide to fill. Plates that have been used several times may have become bent slightly, meaning that slightly more volume is needed for pouring the gel. </p><p><strong>19</strong>.     Place the comb into the cassette, between the plates, as far as it can be pushed in (Figure 7A). Place the comb slowly between the plates and holding it initially at an angle, this well help to not trap any air bubbles between the teeth of the comb.</p><p><strong>20</strong>.     Fix the comb to the plates using two large bulldog clips, to hold the comb firmly in place (Figure 7B). It is important to place the bulldog clips just above the teeth of the comb as indicated in the image, to prevent acrylamide being squeezed out of the cassette.</p><p><strong>21</strong>.     Let the acrylamide set, this will take approximately 1.5 hours.</p><p><strong>22</strong>.     Remove cassette from the rack, remove the bull clips, but Do NOT remove the tape. Wet a paper towel with water and wrap around the cassette, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap (Figures 8A-8C). Store in fridge over night to allow for full polymerisation and best results. Gels can be stored for up to two weeks at 4<sup>o</sup>C with little effect on protein separation.</p><p><strong>23</strong>.     Before running the gel, carefully remove the tape covering the slit of the front pate, but do NOT remove the second piece of tape holding the plates together. Carefully insert the gel cassette into the electrophoresis unit. Add running buffer to the top reservoir. Add running buffer in the bottom chamber only until the meniscus is approximately 1cm above the slit in the front plate. It is important that not more running buffer is added to the bottom reservoir, as otherwise ions could freely move through the sides of cassettes</p><p><strong>24</strong>.     After running the gel, remove the tape and separate the plates. Remove the SDS-PAGE gel for further processing. Remove and discard any excess acrylamide gel and agarose, wash plates in warm water, dry with paper towels, and store until next use.  </p><p><br></p>"
