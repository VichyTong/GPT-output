Instead, use Covaris g-tubes.\r\n\n\n• Save a few µL of original genomic DNA to visualize on an agarose gel later.\r\n\n\n• Add the 150 µL genomic DNA prep to a g-tube. Follow instructions with tubes - Spin in an Eppendorf MiniSpin plus microcentrifuge at 8,600 rpm for 1 min, flip tube over, repeat spin, remove sample from tube.\r\n\n\n• Keep 2 µL of the sheared sample to run on an agarose gel later.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSection 3.2 - Fragment End Repair\r\n\n\n• For 25°C steps throughout protocol, set waterbath to maintain this temperature. Room temperature does not always work.\r\n\n\n• Disregard step 3 \\(don’t need this agarose gel).\r\n\n\n• Step 4m - use the arm on the Labquake to keep the tube from flipping completely over when doing this gentle mixing \\(just rock the tube back and forth).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSection 3.3 - Circularization Adaptor Ligation\r\n\n\n•",

Save a few µL of the sample pre-loading to run on an agarose gel later.\r\n\n\n• To load the sample, bring the sample volume to 120 µL with Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and add 40 µL BluePippin loading dye. Follow cassette instructions to prepare Blue Pippin cassette and load 4 lanes of a cassette by adding 40 µL of sample into each lane. Load the 5th lane with BluePippin marker.\r\n\n\n• Run the BluePippin with the range selection from 5,000-11,000 bp.\r\n\n\n• When finished, remove the size-selected DNA from the elution well into a microfuge tube and rise the elution chamber with 40 µL 0.1% Tween 20 solution \\(supplied with BluePippin), adding this to the tube with the sample.\r\n\n\n• Concentrate and wash the size-selected sample by loading all the BluePippin eluted DNA into an Amicon filter column \\(0.5 mL, 10 K) and spinning for 10 min at 14,000 x g. Discard flow-thru and add 250 µL Tris-HCl to the column. Spin for 15 min at 14,000 x g. Invert column in a clean collection tube and spin for 2 min at 1,000 x g.\r\n\n\n• Save a few µL of concentrated sample to run on an agarose gel later.\r\n\n\n• Run an agarose gel of the original genomic DNA \\(unsheared), g-tube sheared DNA, sample before BluePipping and sample after BluePippin.\r\n\n\n• Continue to next section\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSection 3.5 - Fill-In Reaction\r\n\n\n• At Step 3, quantify with Life Technologies’s Qubit BR dsDNA quantification kit.
