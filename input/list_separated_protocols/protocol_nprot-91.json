Second, among the NOE peaks in this cluster, identify the peak that matches the HNCA peak in <sup>13</sup>C chemical shift within a certain tolerance \\(e.g., ~0.3 ppm). If only one peak is identified, this peak is considered as a sequential or intra-residue C<sup>α</sup>H<sup>α</sup>-NH NOE<sup>10</sup>.

Third, display the TOCSY slice defined by the \\(H, C) chemical shifts of each NOE peak in this cluster and check if the CH spin-pair of the NOE peak correlates with the C<sup>α</sup> spin of this initial spin-system.
