        "body": "_Preparation of bacterial cell lysate with expressed GST/ GST fusion protein_ \r\n\n\n• Inoculate 5ml of LB broth with ampicillin \\(100 μg ml−1) in a culture vial with a single colony of BL21 strain of E.coli \\(transformed with empty pGEX4T-2 or protein of interest cloned in pGEX4T-2) and incubate overnight at 37° C with shaking at 200 rpm.\r\n\n\n• Inoculate1% of overnight grown culture  into 100 ml of LB ampicillin \\(100 μg ml−1) in a conical flask  \\(capacity of 500 ml) and incubate at 37° C with shaking until \r\n\n\nO. D 600  of  0.6  is achieved.\r\n\n\n• Induce the culture with 0.3mM conc. of IPTG for 4 hrs. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 5500 rpm at 4° C for 15 min.\r\n\n\n• Wash the cells twice with 1 X PBS. Resuspend the pellet in protein extraction buffer. Add lysozyme to the concentration of 1mg/ml and incubate on ice for 30 min. with occasional mixing in between.\r\n\n\n• Add Triton X 100 \\(0. 2%) and DNase \\(5µg/ml) to the above mix followed by vigorous shaking.\r\n\n\nIncubate for 1 hr at 4° C with gentle shaking to solubilize the fusion protein.\r\n\n\n• Spin at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Clarify the above supernatant by filtration through 0.4µ filters.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: Cell lysate from BL21 expressing GST \\(Empty pGEX4T-2) is used as control to compare with the cell lysate expressing GST fusion protein. Both samples are processed simultaneously \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Immobilization of bait protein_ \\(GST/GST fusion protein)\r\n\n\n• Prepare 50% slurry of Glutathione Sepharose 4B from 75% slurry. Gently shake the vial of Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin to suspend the slurry. Transfer 1.33ml of slurry into a 15ml Falcon tube for generating 1ml bed volume.\r\n\n\n• Spin at 2100 rpm for 5min. Decant the supernatant carefully  and add 10 bed volume of ice cold 1X PBS  and mix well by inverting. Spin at 2100 rpm for 5 min. followed by decanting of\r\n\n\nsupernatant.\r\n\n\n• Repeat the above step 2 more times.\r\n\n\n• Finally, add 1.0 ml of 1X PBS to the above slurry to prepare 50% slurry. \r\n\n\n• Incubate the clarified crude cell lysate expressing GST or  GST fusion protein \\(described above) with 50% slurry for 2-4 hours at 4° C with gentle shaking\r\n\n\n• Spin at 500 x g for 5 min. Wash the column three times with 10 bed volume of  ice cold 1X PBS.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Incubation of cell lysate \\(consisting of interacting prey protein) with immobilized bait protein_\r\n\n\n• Prepare the cell lysate according to the source organism. For bacteria, the method described above can be followed.  However, yeast cells can be disrupted by glass beads and plant cells can be crushed in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle.\r\n\n\n• Add the clarified cell lysate to   the Glutathione Sepharose 4B column with immobilized GST/ GST fusion protein and incubate for 2-4 hours at 4ºC.\r\n\n\n• Spin at 500 x g for 5 min. Wash the column  three times with 10 bed volume of ice cold 1X PBS.\r\n\n\n• Elute the interacting protein complex by incubating with 1 bed volume of glutathione elution buffer for 15 min. at RT and spin at 500 x g.\r\n\n\n• Repeat this step twice. Collect each elute separately."

        "body": "• The elutes thus obtained  both from column containing both immobilized GST and GST fusion proteins are loaded adjacent to each other on a 10% SDS PAGE gel with appropriate molecular weight marker. \r\n\n\n• Stain the gel with either silver stain or Comassie.\r\n\n\n• Excise the protein bands from the gel for further processing."

        "body": "_Excising and destaining of gel pieces_\r\n\n\n• Wash the gel with sufficient water and place it on a light box to excise the desired bands with a clean scalpel.\r\n\n\n• Cut the bands in to small pieces \\(1x1 or 2x2mm) and transfer into a microcentrifuge tube containing water. Tube can be stored at 4ºC until further processing.\r\n\n\n• Add 200µl of destaining solution to the gel pieces and keep at 37ºC for 30 min. with slow shaking.\r\n\n\n• Discard distaining solution and repeat the step.\r\n\n\n• Add 200 µl 100% ACN to the gel pieces and incubate for 10 min with occasional shaking. The gel pieces should now appear white \\(translucent).\r\n\n\n• Remove ACN from the tube.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Reduction and alkylation of gel pieces_\r\n\n\n• Add 100-200 µl of reducing buffer and incubate at 60 ºC for 1 hr.\r\n\n\n• Remove the reducing buffer and allow to cool at room temperature.\r\n\n\n• Add 200 µl of alkylating buffer for 30 min. in dark at room temperature.\r\n\n\n• Remove and discard alkylating buffer\r\n\n\n• Wash the sample by adding 200 µl of destaining solution and incubate at 37ºC for 15 minutes. Then discard destaining solution.\r\n\n\n• Repeat the above step once more.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Shrink gel pieces_\r\n\n\n• Shrink gel pieces by adding 50-100 µl of acetonitrile. Incubate sample for 15 minutes at room temperature. The gel pieces should now become white \\(translucent).\r\n\n\n• Carefully remove acetonitrile and allow gel pieces to air dry for 5-10min.\r\n\n\nTrypsinization of proteins and recovery of fragments\r\n\n\n• Add 10 µl of the trypsin solution to the tube containing the shrunken gel pieces. Incubate in ice for 10 min and allow gel pieces to swell and absorb the trypsin solution. If 10 µl is not sufficient to cover and fully swell gel pieces, use additional 10ul.\r\n\n\n• Add 25 µl of digestion buffer to the tube. Incubate sample at 37ºC for four hrs or at 30 ºC overnight with shaking.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Extraction of peptides_\r\n\n\n• Remove digestion mixture and place in a clean tube\r\n\n\n• To further extract peptides, add 10 µl of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid or 1% formic acid solution to gel pieces and incubate for 5 minutes. Remove extraction solution and add to digestion mixture. This step also serves to inactivate trypsin.\r\n\n\n• Centrifuge to remove any gel particles to prevent clogging or damage of columns. Transfer to a fresh eppendorf and store at 4ºC."
