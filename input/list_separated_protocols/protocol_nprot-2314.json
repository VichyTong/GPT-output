Ideally ice should not be used in the hood because of the risk of contamination through mold growth. CoolSink BX50 fits into the CoolBox MP, and with the included pre-chilled cartridges, no ice is needed. Alternatively, at a minimum rest the CoolSink on a thermo-conductive ThermalTray LP platform in ice pan to further minimize contact with ice or ice water."

To avoid titer reduction, maintain the vials at 4oC in a CoolBox CFT30 ice-free cooling station. The CoolRack CFT30 cryo vial module standardizes vial temperature and reduces contamination and spill accidents by allowing one-handed opening and closing of the cryo vials while seated in the CoolRack CFT30. \r\n  \r\n\n\n* Most virus preparations consist of virus supernatants from infected cells cleared of cell debris and therefore contain enough serum to act as cryopreservants. However, some viruses need and extra cryopreservant agent such as a 50% sucrose.  Please refer to your laboratory SOP or the literature to assess whether you need to add a special media or cryopreservant to the viral supernatant or preparation."
