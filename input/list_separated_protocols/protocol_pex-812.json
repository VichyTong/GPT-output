    "\n<p><strong>Culturing human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs)</strong></p><p>Maintain hESCs in Nutristem medium (see Reagents &amp; Equipment) on 0.5 &micro;g/cm<sup>2</sup> vitronectin N-precoated tissue culture-treated plastic (<em>e.g.</em> 6 well plates) in a humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Exchange the culture medium daily to fresh medium, warmed to room temperature. Culture the hESCs for at least two passages post-thawing before refreezing (See <strong>Freezing hESCs</strong> section for more information).&nbsp;Only maintain hESCs <em>in vitro</em> for up to six passages post-thawing, for efficient gastruloid generation. Culture beyond this passage number can have variable effects. Maintain stocks under antibiotic free conditions to quickly identify any microbial infections.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Both Nutristem and E6 medium should be allowed to warm to room temperature on the benchtop, and not in a 37°C water-bath or incubator as some of the components are heat-sensitive.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thawing hESCs</strong></p><p>hESCs should be stored for long-term use at -150°C in liquid nitrogen cell banks.

In order to achieve this state, cells can be routinely passaged and monitored so that pre-treatment is performed when cells achieve this culture state (Option 1, below). This option is the version used in the associated manuscript (Moris et. al., 2020) and the resulting gastruloids have been extensively characterised. It does not use ROCK inhibitor to alter the state of the cells, and instead utilises passaging as clusters of cells. Alternatively, we have found that cells can be seeded as a single-cell suspension before pre-treatment to standardise this starting state (Option 2, below). In our hands, this can improve reproducibility between experimentalists by providing a standardised culture method, although this requires ROCK inhibition.</p><p><strong>Option 1: Routine passaging of hESCs before pre-treatment (~3-5 days before pre-treatment)</strong></p><p>1.    Dissociate and passage cells as described in the section describing hESC passaging.</p><p>2.    Closely monitor cells daily to determine the correct timepoint to perform pre-treatment.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Cell density is critical for human gastruloid generation.
