Transfection/Infection\r\n\n\nDepending on the cell type, transfect or infect BoxB. In this protocol, we will use HEK293T and RaPID labeler plasmid \\(E.coli BirA*)\r\n\n\n- Day 0 - Plate 300K HEK293T cells per well in a 6 well plate\r\n\n\n- Day 1 - Transfect 2ug of pMotif plasmid with 0.3ug of RaPID labeler plasmid\r\n\n\n- Day 2 -  Make labeling media. Dilute 20x Biotin \\(4mM Biotin) with DMEM to make labeling media. Aspirate out existing media and add labeling media to each well.\r\n\n\n- Day 3 - Processing Samples\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nC. Processing Samples\r\n\n\nMake Lysis buffer fresh. Wash Buffer 1 can be made and stored at room temperature. Wash Buffers 2-4 can be made in bulk and stored at 4C.",
