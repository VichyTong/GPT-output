            "_Starting with fresh brain tissue_\r\n\n\n1.Immerse whole/hemi-sected human brain tissue in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for 3-4 weeks. To minimize fixation artefact, the brain is suspended in the solution using an inverted porous disposable hairnet. Alternatively, cut brain tissue into 1cm<sup>3</sup> and immerse into 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for 7 days. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Starting with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded \\(FFPE) tissue_\r\n\n\n1.Melt away excess paraffin wax at 60ºC in an incubation oven. \r\n\n\n2.Retrieve tissue from molten paraffin wax and put into a screw-capped glass bottle with xylene, incubate at 55 – 60ºC for at least 6 hours or overnight.\r\n\n\n_Caution: General safety issues with xylene must be observed \\(e.g. use of fume hood, gloves and lab coat). Waste must be appropriately disposed of._\r\n\n\n3.Immerse the tissue into 100% tetrahydrofuran \\(THF) in a screw-capped glass bottle to elute all the xylene out and ensure complete deparaffinisation, incubate for at least 1 hour at room temperature.\r\n\n\n4.Immerse the tissue into 80% THF in water in a screw-capped glass bottle for at least 1 hour at room temperature.\r\n\n\n5.Immerse the tissue into 50% THF in water in a screw-capped glass bottle for at least 1 hour at room temperature.\r\n\n\n6.Immerse the tissue into 20% THF in water in a screw-capped glass bottle for at least 1 hour at room temperature.\r\n\n\n7.Immerse the tissue into SBC solution and incubate at 55oC. Proceed to the usual 3D histology protocol starting from the SDS treatment step.\r\n\n\n8.If the tissue is deemed not well-fixed, immerse in neutral buffered formalin for an additional 3 days at room temperature or overnight at 37ºC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Starting with formalin-fixed tissue_\r\n\n\n1.Cut the tissue to the desired size using a razor blade, microtome blade or disposable scalpel. Alternatively, use a vibrotome or circular saw for more accurate sampling. Try to ensure a flat surface is cut as this will enable better quality images at the later stage. We recommend cutting the tissue to no larger than 3mm thick due to limitation in antibody penetration and imaging objectives working distance. \r\n\n\n2.Immerse tissue into SBC and incubate at 37-55ºC. \\(Optional)\r\n\n\n  •The timing depends on the duration of fixation, the antigens to be stained, as well as the nature or brain region of the tissue to be imaged. In general:\r\n\n\n     oThe longer the tissue fixed in formalin, the longer the SDS treatment recommended.\r\n\n\n     oWhite matter regions require longer SDS treatment \\(at least 10 days is recommended) than grey matter, where 0-5 days may be sufficient for a 1 mm-thick slice.\r\n\n\n     oSDS or incubation at high temperatures \\(50-55ºC) for a long duration has an antigen retrieval effect, therefore the harsher the antigen retrieval method required in tissue sections, the longer the SDS treatment recommended for intact tissue blocks.\r\n\n\n     oThe longer the SDS-treatment, the less brownish discoloration, autofluorescence, and nonspecific binding of antibodies to lipofuscin. Therefore, whenever time allows, longer SDS treatment is recommended.\r\n\n\n  •Do not over-incubate; in general, around three months of incubation is the maximum.\r\n\n\n  •If the tissue is fixed for less than a week, immerse in formalin for a further 3 days at room temperature or overnight at 37ºC.\r\n\n\n3.Wash the tissue in PBST at 37ºC for 3 x 2 hours \\[Tissue can be left in solution for up to 24 hours]. \r\n\n\n  •To minimize tissue damage, tissue should be handed with care and should remain in the same container unless otherwise stated. \r\n\n\n  •To wash the tissue, use a plastic pipette to carefully extract all the solution around the tissue and apply new solution using a clean pipette.",

Using a lower concentration to begin with can facilitate antibody diffusion deeper within the tissue. \r\n\n\n  •Penetration of antibodies is mostly governed by the density of the antigens within the tissue, and antibodies can diffuse through roughly 1 – 2 mm upon overnight incubation. Therefore, prolonged incubation is not necessary and futile in most cases in enhancing antibody penetration.\r\n\n\n  •A 3-day incubation period after the final targeted dilution has been achieved is more than sufficient for practical imaging purposes.\r\n\n\n5.Wash the tissue in PBST at 37ºC for 3x 2 hours and leave overnight."
