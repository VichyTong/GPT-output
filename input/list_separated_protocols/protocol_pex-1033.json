    "\n<p><strong>Reformatting nanobodies to megabodies&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Plasmids encoding megabodies for expression in&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em>&nbsp;can be constructed in a single step starting from any nanobody encoding gene according to&nbsp;<strong>Fig. 3</strong>. Gene fragments encoding&nbsp;β-strands B to G of the parental nanobodies (residues 18-128 according to the IMGT numbering,&nbsp;<strong>Fig. 3a</strong>) need to be amplified by PCR with primers TU89 and EP230. Amplified fragments are next cloned as SapI fragments in the desired expression vector: pMESD2 (GenBank MT328400) or pMESD22c7 (GenBank MT338520) to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;megabodies (~56 kDa), and pMESP23E2 (GenBank MT338521) or pMESP23NO (GenBank MT338522) to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;megabodies (~100 kDa), respectively (<strong>Fig. 3b-e</strong>). We recommend the&nbsp;&nbsp;(cloning vector pMESD22c7) and&nbsp;(cloning vector pMESP23NO) megabody formats for initial experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Amplification of DNA fragments encoding nanobodies</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To amplify a DNA fragment encoding the parental nanobody with two gene-specific primers TU89 and EP230, combine the components and amplify DNA in a thermocycler as indicated in&nbsp;<strong>Table 1</strong>.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyze the PCR products by electrophoresis on a 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel. A DNA fragment of the parental nanobody amplifies as a ~350 bp fragment. Cut the 350-bp PCR product from a 1%&nbsp;(wt/vol)&nbsp;agarose gel and purify the fragment using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantify the DNA from each purification by measuring the OD260.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cloning nanobodies into megabody expression vectors of choice</strong></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the restriction enzyme manufacturer’s instructions to digest 4 μg of a megabody expression vector of choice with SapI and SalI in a 100-μl reaction mix. The supplementary digestion with SalI introduces additional non-complement digestion site and further reduces the sizes (&lt; 20 bp) of two short fragments that are excised from the multi cloning site (MCS) to facilitate the purification of the SapI/SalI digested vector only with the&nbsp;Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.&nbsp;</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel, digest 2 μg of the amplified DNA fragment of the parental nanobody (from Step",
