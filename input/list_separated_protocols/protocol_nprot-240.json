        "body": "Before starting with the actual experiment, titration of the transfection reagent and siRNA for the gene of interest \\(here: cdc2) should be optimized for each cell type under investigation. Use of 3 functional siRNA species against the gene of interest in individual transfections is highly recommended. The gene silencing effect should be tested at the mRNA and protein level and, if possible, phenotypic analysis should be performed. In the experiments described here, individual cell cycle states were estimated by FACS analysis, after cell fixation and Propidium Iodide staining, to confirm cdc2-siRNA–mediated cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase.\r\n\n\nCells transfected with a nonsilencing siRNA and an untreated cell sample should always be set up in parallel to assess the specificity of knockdown. For later statistical analysis, it is advised to perform all experiments in triplicate.\r\n\n\nFor every cell type, optimized experimental conditions should be selected which result in the most pronounced phenotype and strongest knockdown effect for all siRNAs used at their lowest possible concentration. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSince many functional RNAi studies focus on the detection of downstream effects caused by the disappearance of the target protein, GeneChip® array analysis is typically performed 3 days after transfection, when the silenced protein \\(such as the cdc2 protein) is almost completely absent for at least one day. However, although the 3-day time point is frequently used for phenotypic analysis, knockdown studies may display their phenotype at differing time points depending on the gene targeted. This should be taken into account when using these protocols for siRNAs targeting genes other than cdc2. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe following table shows the optimization strategy with the final experimental conditions printed in bold. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/452/original/452.png\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe standard experimental procedures described focus mainly on MCF-7 cells. Notable differences in the protocol for the other cell types used are indicated."
