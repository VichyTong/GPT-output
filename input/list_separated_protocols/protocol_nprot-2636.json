"\nTissue samples from 12 μm-thick frozen sections for RNA analysis were obtained from each hypothalamic\r\n\n\nnucleus or 50 captured GFP-positive or -negative cells onto a single CapSure HS LCM Cap \\(Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA) using the following parameters: spot size = 7.5 μm; power = 50–80 mW; and pulse duration = 50–1,000 ms. Total RNAs were isolated by PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit \\(Arcturs Engineering), and treated with DNase I \\(Invitrogen)."
