    "\nProcedures:\r\n\n\nThis protocol is designed following the lineaments of NOM- 062- ZOO- 199 and the International Council for Laboratory Animals \\(ICLAS).  And following health standards for disposal of biological products. According to the Animal Protection Act of laboratories D.F. 2002 Legislature IV section XII, and the consensus of Helsinki 1995.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPreoperative care:\r\n\n\nPreoperative fasting for 8 hours.\r\n\n\nTransoperative :\r\n\n\nAnesthesia: intramuscular dose ketamine 10mg / kg + Acetopromacina 1 mg / kg . He is to infiltrate the wound with lidocaine 20 mg / ml total dose of 3 ml .\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProcedure:\r\n\n\nWith the subject lying prone, proceed to place an IV in the ear vein of the left ear. Anesthesia is induced the latency time is respected. It is placed in the supine position and then proceeds to trichotomy of the abdomen of the subject. Place supine on the operating table. Subsequently antisepsis with iodine is performed in the abdominal region. Twenty seconds later place sterile fields in surgical area. Anesthesia is tested corroborating that subject doesnâ€™t deserves an extra dose of anesthetic. Proceed to make an incision in mid line of approximately 6 cm skin and subcutaneous tissue. \\(Figure 1 and",

The surgical site is inoculated with E. coli inoculate \\(previously prepared) in order to infest the wound solution. Wait for 3 minutes. \\(Figure.5.) Proceed to place the polypropylene supraponeurotic mesh \\(Figure6.). Place simple points to the aponeurosis with 2-0 polypropylene USP, four cardinal points in order to maintain in place de polypropylene mesh. \\(Figure"

All subjects will undergo autopsies. Cultivation of surgical site in two weeks \\(positive cultures when > 100x106 UFC).\r\n\n\nDocument daily with analysis sheets that includes all the variables and photographs.\r\n\n\nEvery 24 hours the wounds are reviewed for indicators of SSI. Culture must be taken in function fo the degree of infection."
