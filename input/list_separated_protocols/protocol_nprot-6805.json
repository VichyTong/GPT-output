The meaning of each attribute of the JSON parameter file is listed below.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n _Number of Threads Per Process_\r\n\n\nIt stands the number of threads used in each MPI process. Usually, THUNDER hosts one process in each node, for the purpose of minimizing the usage of memory by sharing memory property of threading. As only one process hosted in each node, occupying all cores of CPU\\(s) in each node is accomplished by threads. This value should be set to the number of cores in each node, in this circumstance.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_2D or 3D Mode_\r\n\n\nIt stands for whether THUNDER acts in 2D or 3D. This attributes only takes string 2D or 3D, for setting THUNDER in 2D mode or 3D mode, respectively. If the user desires to perform 2D classification, this attribute should be set to 2D. On the other hand, if the user aims to perform 3D refinement or 3D classification, this attribute should be set to 3D.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n_Global Search_\r\n\n\nIt stands for whether THUNDER performs global search or not.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Local Search_\r\n\n\nIt stands for whether THUNDER performs local search or not.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_CTF Search_\r\n\n\nIt stands for whether THUNDER refines defocus of each single particle or not.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Number of Classes_\r\n\n\nIt stands for the number of classes the user desires that the dataset classified into. For refinement, this attribute is set to"

                "body": "_Pixel Size \\(Angstrom)_\r\n\n\nIt stands for the size of each pixel in Angstrom.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Radius of Mask on Images \\(Angstrom)_\r\n\n\nIt stands for the radius of mask, which will be masked on each single particle image. This attribute should be set to slightly larger than the radius of the targeted macromolecule.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Estimated Translation \\(Pixel)_\r\n\n\nIt stands for the standard deviation of in-plane translation of single particle images. As the translation is unknown before running THUNDER, this attribute is estimated by the user. Larger this attribute is, the wider THUNDER will search in in-plane translation, the longer computing time will be.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Initial Resolution \\(Angstrom)_\r\n\n\nIt stands for the resolution THUNDER starts its iteration. If the user aims to eliminate the bias of initial model, he or she should set this attribute to a low resolution.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Perform Global Search Under \\(Angstrom)_\r\n\n\nIt stands for the resolution threshold where search type switches from global search to local search.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Symmetry_\r\n\n\nIt stands for symmetry type of the macromolecule. For example, C5 stands for 5-fold rotation symmetry along Z axis; D7 stands for 7-fold rotation symmetry along Z axis and 2-fold rotation symmetry along X axis; T stands for tetrahedral symmetry; O stands of octahedral symmetry; I stands for icosahedral symmetry. If the macromolecule is asymmetrical, it should be set to C1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Initial Mode_\r\n\n\nIt stands for the path where THUNDER reads in the initial model.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_.thu File Storing Paths and CTFs of Images_\r\n\n\nIt stands for the path where THUNDER reads in the .thu File. If THUNDER starts from global search, the path and CTF information of each single particle image will be read in. If THUNDER starts from local search or CTF search, besides path and CTF information, the rotation and translation information of each single particle image will be read in as well.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Prefix of Particles_\r\n\n\nIt stands for a prefix added before the path of each single particle image, in order to help THUNDER find the correct path of image.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Prefix of Destination_\r\n\n\nIt stands for a prefix added before the path of output file. It helps THUNDER redirects the output files.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Calculate FSC Using Core Region_\r\n\n\nIt stands for whether THUNDER calculates FSC of the reference\\(s) masked by a sphere or not.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Calculate FSC Using Masked Region_\r\n\n\nIt stands for whether THUNDER calculates FSC of the masked region of the reference\\(s), where the mask is provided by the user.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Particle Grading_\r\n\n\nIt stands for whether THUNDER uses particle grading to weight the contribution of each single particle image during reconstruction.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe JSON parameter file also contains more parameters. However, those parameters are designed for professional users, as beginners can just use default values. Users can find a full description of parameters in JSON parameter file in THUNDER's website."
