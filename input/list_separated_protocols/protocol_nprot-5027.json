Centrifuge with the hinge of the Eppendorf tube facing outwards so that the pellet will accumulate against the wall of the tube at the side with the hinge. Knowing the position of the pellet carefully remove as much of the supernatant as possible \\(approximately 50 μL can be left behind). If the pellet is accidentally removed it may be visible in the pipette tip. Do not discard the supernatant, but transfer it to another Eppendorf tube. Check the supernatant for nuclei \\(see below) – if the supernatant contains nuclei, centrifuge the supernatant again with a spin speed 1000 g greater than the indicated spin speed. Remove the supernatant and add the recovered nuclei back to the original tube \\(this is most easily done by adding the wash buffer or reaction buffer for the subsequent step to the pelleted nuclei and then transferring the nuclei/buffer solution back the original tube. Also make sure that the supernatant from this repeated centrifugation step is free from nuclei. Different cell types behave differently during the centrifugation steps and thus require slightly different spin-speeds. It is important not to loose material during the wash steps so we recommend checking the supernatant for nuclei after each centrifugation step and to re-centrifuge if necessary. Checking for nuclei: mix 10 μL of supernatant with 10 μL trypan blue and visualise nuclei using a light microscope. We use Ibidi slides to aid this process."
