    "\nmESC culture medium preparation:\r\n\n\nGeneral culture conditions are well established 11 and usually require ES \\(embryonic stem) cells to be grown on a Mit-C \\(M0503; Sigma, Germany) treated mitotically-inactive mouse embryonic fibroblast cells \\(mEF) as feeder cell layer in a gelatin \\(G2500; Sigma)-coated tissue culture flask \\(90025; TPP) \\[Fig. 1]. \r\n\n\nmESC line RB1 12 maintained in ES cell medium consisted of Knockout-DMEM \\(10829-018; Gibco, UK) supplemented with 15% ES-qualified FCS \\(10439-024; Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine \\(15039-027; Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol \\(M7522; Sigma), 1% nonessential amino acid stock \\(11140-035; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin \\(15070-063; Gibco).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTip\r\n\n\nMouse embryonic fibroblast cells \\(mEF) are used in co-cultures to provide secreted factors \\(paracrine element), extracellular matrix \\(juxtacrine signaling) and cellular contacts for the maintenance of stem cells in an undifferentiated state without losing their pluripotency. Thus, they are also called feeder cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSubculture of the cells \r\n\n\ni. Prewarm all reagents.\r\n\n\nii. Aspirate all medium from the culture vessel.\r\n\n\niii. Rinse the culture twice with 2 ml PBS-, gently rock the vessel for 30 sec and remove the buffer to dispose of all traces of medium containing FBS.\r\n\n\niv. Add the appropriate amount of trypsin to each flask to cover the entire surface of the flask. Incubate the culture at room temperature for approximately 1 minute. Rock the flask for 4-5 times quickly back and forth such that the trypsin coats the cells. After 1 minute incubation, wash the culture vigorously by pipetting the trypsin solution up and down over the cells such that the small amount of fluid in the flask shears the loosely attached cells off and dissociates the clumps. \r\n\n\nv. Inactive the trypsin by adding fresh, complete medium. Be sure to triturate thoroughly to achieve a single cell suspension before inactivating. Replate as desired.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSynchronization protocol for mESCs\r\n\n\ni. Add 2 mM thymidine for 16 hours at 25-30% confluency of the stem cell culture. \r\n\n\nii. Remove thymidine by washing with 1x PBS. Add fresh KO-DMEM complete medium for 4 hours to release cells. Cells progress synchronously through the G2- and mitotic phases.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHypotonization\r\n\n\nBased on criteria by Fenech 13 for the selection of bi-nucleate cells suitable for scoring MNi, a bi-nucleate cell can be scored only if the nuclear boundaries of each nucleus are distinguishable. In addition, the cytoplasmic membrane of bi-nucleated cells must be intact and clearly distinct from adjacent cells. Thus, it is important that mESCs harvested properly without any damage to the cytoplasmic membrane.\r\n\n\nMicronucleus assay in isolated lymphocyte or cell lines culture does not require hypotonic treatment during harvesting. Hypotonic treatment may destroy necrotic and apoptotic cells, making them unavailable for assay",

According to the all above items mentioned it seems the hypotonic treatment of mESCs is necessary and cannot be omitted.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHarvest & slide making\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\ni. Treat ES cells grown on mEF with 4 µg/ml cyt-B \\(c-6762; Sigma) for 14 hours. \r\n\n\nii. Trypsinize the cells and spin them down at 800 g for 6 minutes. \r\n\n\niii. Resuspend the cell pellet gently by tapping the tube. Add about 4 ml of hypotonic solution. \r\n\n\niv. After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, spin down the cells again and fix the pellet with cool Carnoy\\`s fixative \\(methanol: acetic acid; 3:1) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Disperse cells before the addition of fixative.\r\n\n\nv. Change the fixative twice. \r\n\n\nvi. Drop the suspension on wet slides previously cleaned with ethanol. \r\n\n\nvii. Air-dry the slides. Stain with Hoechst 33258 \\(Calbiochem; 382061) and rhodamin B \\(Sigma; R6626). \r\n\n\nviii. Examine slides under a microscope equipped with fluorescent optic \\(Olympus Bx51). Cells are scored blindly for MN presence. In our study, the frequency was expressed as number of MNi per one bi-nucleated cell \\(mean± SD).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCritical \r\n\n\nDo not air-dry slides for longer than 10 minutes, otherwise cell and molecular morphology become altered, it makes difficult to score the slides. Store the slides in a microscope slide box in a cool, dry and dust-free cupboard.\r\n\n\nScoring\r\n\n\nWe examined one thousand bi-nucleated cells to measure MN formation in each slide prepared per sample \\(treated and control). For more details, we followed the Fenech"
