                "body": "The reverse transcription \\(RT) primer is designed such that at the temperature used for reverse transcription it adopts a stable stem-loop structure \\(dG < -1.5), while under qPCR conditions the stem-loop structure is no longer favored \\(dG > -0.5). mFold software10 \\(http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/) is used to predict conformations and free energy values of the reverse transcription primer under the conditions used for reverse transcription and qPCR respectively \\(Fig. 2b). The last 6 nucleotides at the 3’ end of the reverse transcription primer are the reverse complement of the last 6 nucleotides of the miRNA of interest.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA pair of qPCR primers is then designed where the reverse primer \\(with respect to the original miRNA sequence) extends at least one nucleotide beyond the 6 nucleotides used for reverse transcription priming while the 5’ end anneals to the stem-loop region of the RT primer \\(Fig. 2a). The forward primer extends such that it is at most head-to-head with the reverse primer \\(i.e. PCR gap = 0 nt) and will usually requires a 5’ GC rich sequence for efficient amplification. Due to the short lengths of the miRNAs, qPCR amplicons generated may be of almost indistinguishable size compared to primer-dimer products, unless dissociations are carried out using high-resolution melt analyses. It is thus critical to minimize primer-primer hybridization to avoid non-specific amplification. Most primer designing softwares \\(e.g. Beacon Designer, DNAman, Premier Primer) allow the evaluation of primer-primer complementarity. There is also a free online edition of Beacon Designer \\(http://www.premierbiosoft.com/qOligo/Sequence.jsp?PID=1) that is adequate for this purpose \\(Fig. 2c).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFigure"
