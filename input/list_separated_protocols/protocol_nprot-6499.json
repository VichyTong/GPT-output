Mix and incubate for 30 min on ice. \r\n\n\n• Vortex RapidSpheres and add to sample at 100μl/ml \\(1ml /10ml). Mix well and incubate on ice for 15 min.\r\n\n\n• Divide 10 ml total volume of sample into two 5 ml samples \\(Use 15 ml conical Falcon tubes).\r\n\n\n• Bring each sample to a 10 ml total volume with Easysep buffer, and place the tube in The Big Easy magnet for 10 minutes. Pour the supernatant into a new empty 15 ml Falcon tube. Repeat the magnet wash for higher purity.\r\n\n\n• Pellet lineage- depleted cells by centrifugation at 1400 rpm for 5 min."
