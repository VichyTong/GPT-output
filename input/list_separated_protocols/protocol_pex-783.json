Allow the eggs to sit in the drop for approximately 1 minute. Watch for loosening of the zona under a stereomicroscope.</p><p><br></p><p>3.    When the zona begins to slough off, carefully transfer the eggs though 2-3 drops of 0.9% sodium citrate to rinse off the Tyrode solution. The zona should be completely removed by the time the egg is in the last drop (pipetting the egg up and down to help zona removal). At this point the eggs will become quite sticky - use care while handling them to prevent bursting. </p><p><br></p><p>4.    Remove slide from PFA, dab the end on a paper towel to remove excess solution, and place on stereomicroscope.</p><p><br></p><p>5.    Take the oocyte from the Na<sub>2</sub>citrate solution using the micropipette and pipette onto the PFA-soaked slide within the etched circle (do this under a stereomicroscope). <strong>It is important to limit the amount of media that is transferred, as it will dilute the formaldehyde solution solution. </strong>The eggs should be seen bursting in the formaldehyde solution. If the eggs don’t start lysing you can agitate the surrounding liquid with the pipette until you see the egg start to lyse. Do not agitate too much as it will cause the chromosomes to spread excessively on the slide and cause unintended chromosomal loss.</p><p><br></p><p>6.    Taking care to keep the slide absolutely flat, transfer slides to a humidity chamber (prewarmed) for gradual drying for several hours to overnight (we’ve tested 2 hour to overnight and there’s no differences).</p><p><br></p><p>7.    After slides have dried, add photoflo <em>(Sigma 146 4510)</em> (500 µL in 50 mL of water) to a Coplin jar.
