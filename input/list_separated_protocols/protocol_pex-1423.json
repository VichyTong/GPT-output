Take a 1 ml aliquot of milk and transfer it to a 2.2 mL Eppendorf tube using an automatic pipet.</p><p>3. Add 1 mL of solution A to the 2.2 mL Eppendorf tube containing the milk sample (1:1 - sample: solution A).</p><p>4. Shake each mixture in a vortex for 10 s at medium speed.</p><p>5. Incubate the mixture at room temperature (25 °C) for 1 h.</p><p>Note: you can climate the room (25 °C) in which incubation is running by using an air conditioning unit. Standardization of the incubation conditions contributes to low variations across different processing days.</p><p>6. Centrifuge at 14200 x g for 5 min.</p><p>7. An upper fat layer is formed after centrifugation. Then, carefully remove it using a micro-spatula.</p><p>8. Take 450 μl of the supernatant and transfer it to a new 2.2 mL Eppendorf tube. To this same tube, add 1350 μl of solution B (1:3 - supernadant: solution B).</p><p>9. Transfer 1 mL of the mixture to a vial for HPLC analysis.</p><p>10. Analyze the samples by RP-HPLC-DAD. Note: storage the samples under refrigeration at 4 °C until analysis.</p><p><strong>Chromatographic analysis (conditions)</strong></p><p>- Column temperature: 45 °C.</p><p>- Injection volume: 5 µL.</p><p>- Stationary phase: Hypersil GOLD C8 column (3 µm, 150 x 4.6 mm) equipped with Hypersil GOLD C8 guard column (5 µm, 10 mm).</p><p>- Working wavelength: 214 nm.</p><p>- Mode: gradient, constant flow: 0.500 mL/min (see the elution gradient in table 1, supplementary files).</p><p><strong>NIRS analysis</strong></p><p>Determine the total protein and casein contents in g/100 g milk in the sample using a NIRS equipment.
