    "\n<p><strong>Tip: Detailed methodologies for the routine culture of hESc on iMEF feeder layers can be found in the ‘ES Cell International Pte Ltd: Methodology Manual Human Embryonic Stem Cell Culture 2005’ and the ‘Human Embryonic Stem \\(HUES) Cell Collection Instruction Manual Version 1.0 \\(http://mcb.harvard.edu/melton/hues/HUES_manual.pdf). We have progressively modified the protocols in these instruction manuals as we have become more experienced in hESc culture.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCritical: All cell culture procedures are carried out in a microbiological safety cabinet using aseptic technique. Because we do not supplement hESc Medium, hESc Feeder-Free Medium and Directed Differentiation Basal Medium with antibiotics it is essential that particular care is taken to maintain an aseptic environment. The cell culture incubators are cleaned monthly with a stringent biocide and rinsed with 70% \\(vol/vol) ethanol before running an internal autoclave cycle. Humidity within the cell culture incubators is maintained by filling water trays with autoclaved dH2O. The microbiological safety cabinet is cleaned weekly with a stringent biocide and rinsed with 70% \\(vol/vol) ethanol. During processing all reagents and equipment are sprayed liberally with 70% \\(vol/vol) ethanol before transfer into the microbiological safety cabinet and the operator wears a long sleeve Howie style laboratory coat and latex/nitrile gloves at all times. Cells are cultured at 37ºC in 5% Co2, atmospheric O2.</strong></p>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n",
