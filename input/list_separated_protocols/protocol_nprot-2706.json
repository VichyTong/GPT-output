Note: Image magnification and scanning frame rates are suggested as a starting point and may be adapted based on the specific hardware available. Tumor imaging is generally performed at lower magnification to increase the probability of detecting significant numbers of particles. A 20 – 25× objective, commonly used for IVM, is readily substituted. With digital zoom, such an objective can yield magnifications upwards of 60×, which is sufficient for detecting most nanoparticles. The scanning rates described here are sufficient to capture nanoparticle accumulation kinetics but are too slow for imaging RBC or particle trajectories. If trajectory measurements are needed, images should be acquired such that an object’s spatial position change is less than or equal to the object size.
