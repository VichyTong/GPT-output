In this experiment, negative charges of the parasite surface, mainly due to the sialic acid content, interact or bind to positively charged DE52 medium. Since the content of sialic acid of trypomastigotes is higher, this parasite form strongly binds to the resin, whereas the amastigotes, which have no \\(intracellular forms) or less \\(extracellular forms) sialic acid content, bind only weakly to the positively charged column."
