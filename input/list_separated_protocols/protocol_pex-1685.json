    "\n<p>Ensuing transfection, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) serving as a screenable gene marker took roughly around 48 to 72 hours to reach a detectable threshold of a fluorescent microscope. Several papers have reported that the transfection aid materials including the Lipofectamine 2000 and 3000 reflect a cell-dependent efficacy, which requires further optimization for each cell type (9). Studies demonstrate that the Cos-7 cell line holds the transfection efficiency of roughly 95%; other efforts cite that cells such as Caco-2 display a rather lower efficiency of 75%. Studies focusing on HEK293 cells have elucidated Lipofectamine 3000 results in higher cellular plasmid uptake when compared with other variants such as Lipofectamine 2000 (10). Furthermore, some cell types are intrinsically more resilient to obtaining foreign genetic materials from the environment, neuroblastoma cells and primary astrocyte cells were cited to be among such categories of cells with approximately 10–12% and 5–12% efficiency, respectively (11). Here, we observed that roughly 50 % of cells absorbed the plasmids containing the target and the reporter genes. To facilitate the transfection process we exploited the Lipofectamine 2000. Single cells were observed in 30 wells under a stereomicroscope, proliferated to constitute a clone of 40 cells after 10-12 days (Figure 2).</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Our results are in concordance with previous studies demonstrating that roughly, a third proportion of the entire wells contains a cell or scattered cells, ensuing the diluting process (7). </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As cells’ characteristics are distinctive to their type, they may differ in matters of cell-cell interactions; therefore, they may require more time to form. Our experiences unveiled that during the first 5 to 6 days of incubation and frequent media change, the single cell-derived clone begins to form and is observable after 10 to 12 days. </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To identify the desired genetic modifications the automated Sanger sequencing method is recommended, for high-throughput sequencing analysis, derivative methods of Sanger sequencing including pyrosequencing and illumine-based sequencing have also proven to be highly effective approaches. TA cloning is the method of choice for separating the different alleles of genes to identify the heterogeneity.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Sequence analysis without prior selection of single cells and the separation of alleles may lead to witnessing different peaks for the same spot. Interpreting such findings would be an insurmountable task, therefore prior isolations are highly recommended.</p><p>Figure",
