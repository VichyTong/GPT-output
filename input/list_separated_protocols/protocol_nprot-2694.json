    "\nPhosphate Buffer \\(0.1M, pH 7.0)\r\n\n\nIt is prepared by dissolving 1.74g of Dipotassium hydrogen phosphate \\(K2HPO4) in 100mL Deionized water and 1.36g of Potassium phosphate monobasic \\(KH2PO4) in 100mL deioinized water. Mix 61.5mL of K2HPO4 and 38.5 mL of KH2PO4 and raise the volume 1 Litre to get 0.1M Phosphate buffer \\(pH 7.0).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPhosphate Buffer \\(150mM, pH 7.1)\r\n\n\nIt is prepared by dissolving 2.61g of K2HPO4 in 100mL Deionized water and 2.04g of KH2PO4 in 100mL deioinized water. Mix 61.5mL of K2HPO4 and 38.5 mL of KH2PO4 and raise 1 Litre to get 150mM Phosphate buffer \\(pH 7.1)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPreparation of Standard Solution\r\n\n\nOrnithine-HCl: Dissolve 1.682mg of L-Ornithine HCl in 10mL of phosphate buffer \\(pH 7.0). Dilute the stock solution to obtain working solution in the range of 0.2-100μM.\r\n\n\nPutrescine Dihydrochloride: Dissolve 1.6107mg of Putrescine Dihydrochloride in 10mL of phosphate buffer \\(pH 7.0). Dilute the stock solution to obtain working solution in the range of 0.2-100μM.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nReaction Mixture: Dissolve 17.57μL of β-mercaptoethanol \\(2.5 mM), 55.84mg of Disodium EDTA \\(1.5mM), 2μL of stock solution of Pyridoxal phosphate prepared in 150mM Phosphate buffer \\(75nM) and 50.6mg of L-Ornithine HCl \\(3mM) in 150mM Phosphate buffer \\(pH 7.1).\r\n\n\nPicryl Sulfonic acid \\(TNBS): 25.7μL of TNBS dissolved in 10mL of 1-Pentanol, freshly prepared and kept at 4ºC\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCaution\\! β-mercaptoethanol is a toxic by inhalation, cause damage to skin and eyes by prolonged exposure, so this chemical bottle should be opened inside fume hood and for very short time. Wear masks and gloves while using it.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n0.1M Sodium Borate: Dissolve 3.8137g in 100mL Deionized water, adjust pH \\(8.0) by 1M either NaOH and/or 1M HCl.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4N sodium Hydroxide: Dissolve 16.0g in 100mL of Deionized water.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1M Perchloric acid: Commercial solution available is calculated as 12M. To use we have to make 1M solution. For this, take 86mL of stock pure solution and raise up to 1000mL with deionized water. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCaution\\! Heating may cause explosion, contact with combustible material should be avoided, use carefully as it causes eye irritation. Perchloric acid and 10% Trichloroacetic acid is highly corrosive and handling should be done in a chemical fume hood\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOrnithine Decarboxylase Enzyme solution: Stock solution is made as 10mg of enzyme dissolved in 1mL of phosphate buffer \\(150mM). It means that 0.6 units/mg protein in 1mL\r\n\n\nThe enzyme is kept at -20ºC and stock solution is prepared in 150mM Phosphate buffer immediately before starting experiment. The enzyme is highly labile and should be kept at 4 ºC while performing the assay. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10mM Picrylsulfonic acid solution: 25.7μL of TNBS solution dissolved in 10mL of 1-Pentanol.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCaution\\! Store 1-Pentanol in cool place, containers opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to prevent leakage as it is flammable. It is a harmful by inhalation, cause skin dryness, irritating to respiratory system and eyes. Wear masks and gloves while using it.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPROCEDURE",
