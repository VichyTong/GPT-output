To avoid losing sequencing power and increase detection sensitivity, we have therefore developed a targeted depletion approach using DNA antisense oligos followed by RNase H treatment. These oligos were designed to bind within the first 40 nt of small abundant capped RNAs. The most abundant sn- and snoRNAs based on a first run without depletion were chosen as targets (Table"

However, due to their abundance, it is possible that a substantial portion of rRNAs can stick to the beads.
