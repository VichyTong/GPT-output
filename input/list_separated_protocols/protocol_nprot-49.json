This classical normalization method scales the individual intensities so that the mean intensities are the same across all arrays, and we applied to the data by an in-house developed program. Transcripts that demonstrate differences greater than 2-fold in duplicate analysis of the same NK sample examined should be excluded from the analysis. The raw intensity data should be normalized after exclusion of such genes. Additionally, 20 should be set to be the minimal normalized hybridization intensity value \\(in other words, all intensities below 20 should be brought up to this value).  This was decided after observing that a set of more than 10 transcripts \\(e.g., CD20, CD4, CTLA4, etc.), known to be absent in NK cells and/or in human cells, showed hybridization intensity values below this threshold. Reproducibility of the gene expression data can be assessed by plotting gene expression levels from each of the two replicate experiments. Linear correlation coefficient for the plot should be above 0.98 \\(data not shown).  This observation provides a justification to average normalized hybridization intensity values for dNK sample replicate experiments, and to use these values for estimating gene expression patterns."
