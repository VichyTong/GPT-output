    "\n5.7.1 STAINING\r\n\n\nThis assay is performed in the Oncology Laboratory in the: \r\n\n\nMolecular Pathology Room:  Microtomy\r\n\n\nMain laboratory: Immunohistochemistry staining\r\n\n\nExtraction Room: Drying out and mounting\r\n\n\nNotes on the protocol \r\n\n\nAntigen retrieval is performed by warm incubation in EDTA buffers \\(ph8). The main problem with this method is that some epitopes are irreversibly damaged by heat, something which is more likely to occur if the tissue is poorly fixed. Special adhesive layers are used to avoid tissue cuts becoming unstuck \\(See section 5.5.2). The method of antigen retrieval, incubation time and concentration of the antibody vary according to the staining used \\(see table below). This is performed at 95ºC, except for PDL1 which is carried out at 100ºCX.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMicrotomy",
