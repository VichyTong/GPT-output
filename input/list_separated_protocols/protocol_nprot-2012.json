    "\nA. Plant material\r\n\n\nGenomic DNA of the variety BR-16 \\(Embrapa) was isolated from young leaves with the DNeasy Plant Kit \\(QIAGEN), following the manufacturer’s instructions, and quantified with a NanoDrop 3300 \\(Thermo Scientific). The concentration was confirmed by analysis with a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and adjusted to 10 ng/µl with distilled water. The DNA was kept at -20 °C until it was analysed using polymerase chain reaction \\(PCR).\r\n\n\n■ PAUSE POINT Genomic DNA and PCR products can be stored at -20 °C for several days without a loss of quality.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nB. Cloning of the regulatory sequences\r\n\n\nFor amplification of the signal peptide and the promoter region of the alpha’ subunit from the beta-conglycinin soybean protein, the primers CongF and CongR were constructed. These primers were chosen based on the alpha’ subunit promoter and signal peptide sequence available in GenBank \\(accession number: M13759). The primer sequences can be viewed in Table 1 and include sites for the restriction enzymes _Xho_ I and _Hin_d III. The primers anneal to the start of the promoter region and to the end of the signal peptide, respectively, resulting in the amplification of a 1,148-bp fragment when using Platinum _Taq_ DNA Polymerase High Fidelity, according to the manufacturer’s \\(Invitrogen) instructions, and a PTC-100 Peltier thermal cycler \\(Tables 2 and",
