        "body": "Detection of analyte\r\n  \r\n\n\nIn activated and untreated polystyrene microtiter plates  analyte \\( human IgG, human IgE) was detected by immobilizing capture molecule \\(anti-human IgG, anti-human IgE,) onto the activated and untreated polystyrene microtiter plates by ultrasound waves in a sonicator bath followed by blocking , binding  of analyte  and secondary antibody-conjugate by the same conditions. The plates were washed after each step. Color development was carried out by adding  100 µl of substrate- dye buffer and then stopped by adding 20 µl of 5% sulphuric acid. Absorbance was recorded  at 490 nm."
