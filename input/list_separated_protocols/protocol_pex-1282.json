For that, add 8&nbsp;ml medium to the culture plates, then dilute the cells to a concentration of 2x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and add 10 ml of this cell suspension to the plates.</p><p>Note: To have enough cells for the production expand your cells to ~18 T175 flasks four days before seeding. Check the condition of the cells before seeding. For the transfection, we prefer to work with 15&nbsp;cm culture plates instead of T175 flasks, though this is also possible. Plates have a higher risk for contaminations, but allow a quicker workflow as they are easier to handle, especially when many plates have to be processed.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL</strong> Handling of the plates: Be careful not to move your hand or material above an uncovered plate to avoid contaminations. Evenly spread the cells on the plates by carefully tilting the plate back and forth and from left to right after seeding.</p><p><strong>?

The cells should be equally distributed over the plate (no cluster formation) with a confluency of around 75-90% and should not grow 3-dimensionally.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>The colour of the medium should be orange, not red (low cell density) nor turbid yellow indicating a contamination.</p><p>The cells must at least cover 75% of the plate’s surface to transfect them. They should rather be above this threshold, yet they have to survive two more days in culture.</p><p><strong>? TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace medium in all dishes by 12&nbsp;ml DMEM containing 15% FBS and 2&nbsp;mM L‑glutamine</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>Cells should not be kept with this low amount of medium for longer than 1 h&nbsp;30 min. This can be achieved by first changing the medium of 20 plates, then starting to prepare the DNA Mix and PEI Mix (step 4), and performing the medium change of the remaining 20 plates during the incubation time of the transfection mix.</p><p><strong>? TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately prepare the DNA Mix and PEI Mix required for transfection in conical-bottom, sterile polypropylene tubes. First, prepare DNA Mix in a 250&nbsp;ml tube and then prepare PEI Mix in another 250&nbsp;ml tube. The following amounts are for transfection of 40 cell culture plates:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>DNA mix:</u> Combine 92&nbsp;ml DMEM without any supplement with 606.9&nbsp;µg pS‑CD19.CAR‑W and 577.8&nbsp;µg pCMV‑dR8.91. As a next step, add 35.9 µg of pCAGGS-NiV-GcΔ34-αCD8opt and 179.5 µg pCAGGS-NiV-FcΔ22 for production of CD8-LV or 53.9 µg of pCG-Hmut-CD4.DARPin29.2 and 161.5 µg of pCG-FcΔ30 for production of CD4-LV.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>PEI mix:</u> Combine 5.6&nbsp;ml PEI with 88&nbsp;ml DMEM without supplements</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: Amounts can be downscaled to e.g. five 15&nbsp;cm cell culture plates per vector.</p><p><strong>? TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p>The total amount of plasmid DNA per plate is 35&nbsp;µg with a ratio of 1:3:11.3:10.7 between targeted glycoprotein plasmid, fusion protein plasmid, transgene plasmid and packaging plasmid for CD8-LV (as for other NiV glycoprotein based LVs) and a ratio of 1:5:16.9:16.1 for CD4-LV (as for other MV glycoprotein based LVs). The amount of PEI per µg of DNA is 3.68&nbsp;µg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The transgene plasmid can be freely chosen. When setting up LVs targeted to other receptors we recommend using GFP for validation. Plasmid ratios may have to be adapted when using transgenes of different size. For third generation packaging LVs plasmid amounts have to be adapted as follows: Instead of using 577.8 µg pCMV-dR8.91 use 385.0 µg of the plasmid coding for Gag/Pol (pMDLg/pRRE, addgene #12251) and 192.77 µg of the plasmid coding for Rev (pRSV-Rev, addgene #12253). The other plasmid amounts are not changed.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: VSV-LVs should be produced as a positive control, when testing new transgenes. Use 245 µg of the VSV-G envelope plasmid (pMD2.G, addgene #12259), 700 µg of the transgene plasmid and 455 µg of the packaging plasmid.</p><p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoroughly mix PEI-Mix and DNA-Mix individually by vortexing for 30 seconds, respectively. Then add PEI-Mix to DNA-Mix and vortex again for 30&nbsp;seconds. Incubate for 20-30&nbsp;min at room temperature.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL</strong> To not exceed this incubation time medium change of at least 20 plates should be completed before preparing the transfection mix.</p><p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the incubation period, pipette 4.6&nbsp;ml of the transfection mix from step 5 to each plate using a 10-ml pipette. Carefully tilt the plates to disperse the medium evenly.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL</strong> Avoid disturbing the attached cells by slightly tilting the plate and carefully pipetting the solution SLOWLY to its border. Distribution of the transfection mix drop by drop is not necessary. Transfect only 10 plates at a time and leave the rest of the plates in the incubator to keep the cells in optimal culture condition.</p><p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return the dishes to the tissue culture incubator with a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C and incubate them over night for 16-18&nbsp;h.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>Stack the dishes horizontally to make sure cells are completely covered with medium any time.</p><p>Note: Transfection can also be performed in the morning (if cell density is &gt; 75%). In this case, medium is replaced 6-8 h after transfection on the same day. Harvest of LV particles will still be two days after transfection, as described in this protocol.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Medium change Timing: Day 3 early morning (~16 h post transfection)</strong></p><p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently aspirate the medium from the cells and add 18&nbsp;ml DMEM (10% FBS, 2&nbsp;mM L‑glutamine). Incubate the plates in a tissue culture incubator with a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C for 24&nbsp;h.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>Only take 10 plates at a time out of the incubator to keep the cells in optimal culture condition. Change the medium of only two plates at once to avoid cell dehydration.</p><p>Note: If cells were transfected in the morning, medium is replaced 6-8 h after transfection on the same day. When using T175 flasks 20 ml DMEM is required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harvest of lentiviral vector particles Timing: Day 4 morning</strong></p><p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get rid of cell debris, filter the cell supernatant through a 0.45&nbsp;µm Bottle Top Filter placed on a 500&nbsp;ml storage bottle. One filter is sufficient for filtration of the supernatant of 20&nbsp;plates. Filter the LV-containing supernatant by connecting a pump to the filter and collect the flow through.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>Keep the supernatant on ice after filtration.</p><p><strong>PAUSE POINT</strong> Store at least one aliquot of the unconcentrated filtered cell culture supernatant at ‑80°C (4°C in case of titration on the next day) to later compare titers of unconcentrated and concentrated vector stocks. An additional vector harvest after another 24&nbsp;h can be considered to increase vector yields<strong>.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Concentration of vector stock over sucrose cushion Timing: Day 4 – 5</strong></p><p>10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribute the filtered supernatant to four 250&nbsp;ml conical centrifuge tubes. Aspirate 14&nbsp;ml of the 20% sucrose solution with a 10-ml pipette. Insert the pipette to the bottom of the centrifuge tube containing the filtered supernatant and slowly underlay with 9&nbsp;ml of the sucrose solution. Stop expelling the solution when it hits the 5&nbsp;ml mark on the pipette. Discard the rest of the solution and use a new pipette for the next tube.</p><p>Note: The extra volume in the pipet is necessary to avoid bubbles in the tube, since the 5 ml mark of a 10-ml pipet is still visible when being inserted in the centrifuge tube containing the supernatant.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>The sucrose cushion should be pipetted very gently to avoid mixing of the two phases.</p><p>11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance the tubes by addition of PBS w/o Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> until the weight difference is below 0.1&nbsp;g.</p><p>Note: Weighing can be done outside the cell culture hood, although the tubes have to be kept closed. However, PBS has to be added under the cell culture hood to maintain sterility.</p><p>12)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centrifuge for 24&nbsp;h at 4°C (4500×g; acceleration: 6; deceleration:",

Set the centrifuge on “Hold” to be sure it does not finish before you are ready to proceed.</p><p>Note: You can also concentrate the vectors by ultracentrifugation (SW32 Ti Rotor) for 2 h at 100,000×g, but due to the volume restrictions, we prefer low speed centrifugation. If you decide for ultracentrifugation, we recommend using Open-Top Thinwall polypropylene tubes (Beckmann Coulter, 38.5 ml, 25x89 mm, cat. no. 326823) for centrifugation of the supernatant. These tubes have to be filled to the maximum to prevent collapsing. If necessary, fill up the supernatant to exactly 30 ml with PBS w/o Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> before adding 5 ml sucrose solution.</p><p>Note: If production is downscaled to less than 10 plates per vector, concentration of LVs can be performed in 50 ml conical centrifuge tubes. In this case, supernatant should be aspirated with a 10 ml pipette and filtered with a 0.45 µm syringe filter. One filter can be sufficient for two plates by carefully detaching the pipet without clogging the filter (e.g. by keeping ~ 3 ml volume in the pipet). The filtered supernatant of two culture plates is transferred in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and underlayed with 4.5 ml 20% sucrose by aspirating 7.5 ml of the sucrose solution with a 5-ml pipette and stopping to expel the solution when it hits the 3 ml mark on the pipette.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Resuspension of concentrated lentiviral vectors Timing: Day 5</strong></p><p>13)      Carefully remove the tubes from the centrifuge and discard the supernatant.

Pipette up and down 80 times with an electronic pipette. Pool the liquids from all resuspended pellets in one of the conical tubes and aliquot the vector stock in low binding tubes in volumes of 15-200 µl (15-25 µl for nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) or p24-ELISA and titration, 200 µl for <em>in vivo</em> analyses). Store the vectors at ‑80°C.</p><p>Note: Especially for LVs containing MV envelope proteins resuspension of the pellet in a too low volume can be counterproductive. We recommend addition of 100 µl PBS per plate, when starting with a new type of targeted LV.<u> </u></p><p>Note: It is also possible to use a conventional mechanical pipette for resuspension of the pellet.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>Avoid foam formation during resuspension of the pellets to prevent aerosols.</p><p><br></p><p><strong> PAUSE POINT </strong>Lentiviral vectors can be stored at -80°C.

For this purpose, cells are seeded in 100 µl RPMI medium (10% FBS, 2 mM L‑glutamine) and the vector stock, diluted in 100 µl medium, is added to get a final volume of 200 µl per well. The percentage of transduced cells is determined via flow cytometry three or four days later. Antibodies depend on the corresponding transgene. In this case, an anti-myc-PE antibody was used for detection of the CAR (Fig. 4c).</p><p>Note: If other targeting vectors are produced, the cell line for titration and the used antibody for detection of the transgene must be adjusted.
