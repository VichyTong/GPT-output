Select only tissue pieces larger than 1 cm<sup>3</sup> which can be confidently identified as decidua compacta or decidua spongiosa.\r\n\n\n3 Wash the selected tissue in basic culture medium with gentle stirring for 20 min to remove contaminating blood. \r\n\n\n4 Tip into a petri dish. Transfer tissue pieces with forceps to a clean dish and mince with scalpels to 0.5-1mm<sup>3</sup> pieces.\r\n\n\n5 Transfer minced tissue to a 60mL lidded, disposable container of sufficient diameter to allow mixing of the contents by agitation. \r\n\n\n6 Add 10 -30ml warmed collagenase/dispase solution. Seal the lid and place in a heated shaker at 370C with gentle shaking to digest. \r\n\n\n7 Sample the digest after 20 min and subsequently at 10-min intervals to check for the appearance of free glandular elements. Stromal cells disaggregate more quickly than glands and will disperse into the supernatant leaving intact tubular gland structures that are visible under the phase-contrast microscope.  When these are abundant dilute the enzyme/tissue mix with RPMI-1640 medium to minimise further disaggregation. Transfer to a larger container if necessary.\r\n\n\n8 Swirl the container firmly \\(but do not shake) and leave to stand for 2 min to allow undigested tissue fragments to sediment.\r\n\n\n9 Pass the supernatant through one or more 100µm cell sieves. Wash through well with RPMI-1640 medium.\r\n\n\n10 Invert the sieves over a petri dish and backwash the glandular elements from the membrane by forceful pipetting using a plastic Pasteur pipette. Transfer the backwashed glands to a universal tube and pellet by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min. \r\n\n\n11 Re-suspend glandular elements in 1-2ml Advanced DMEM/F12 medium.  Gently pipette up and down several times to partially dissociate cells. Transfer to 1.5ml microcentrifuge tubes and pellet by centrifugation. \r\n\n\n12 Remove the supernatant and estimate the volume of the pellet. Flick the tube to loosen the pellet and place on ice for 2-3 min. Add 20 x volume:volume  of ice-cold Matrigel and pipette gently to mix.  Place tube back onto ice immediately.\r\n\n\n13 Plate 20-25μl drops of Matrigel/cell suspension into the centre of wells of Corning 48-well tissue culture plates. Place in the incubator to set for 15 min.\r\n\n\n14 Overlay each drop with 250μl Expansion Medium.\r\n\n\n15 Examine cultures for the appearance of hollow spheroids, replacing the expansion medium every 2-3 d. \r\n\n\n16 When spheroids/organoids are abundant passage as below. N.B. If there is dense material in the wells after 2 weeks with no visible spheroids they should still be passaged at this stage."

        "body": "1 Without removing the culture medium, use a 1ml pipette tip to scrape backwards and forwards across the growth surface of each well to detach the Matrigel drop into the medium. Transfer the contents of the wells into 1.5mL   microcentrifuge tubes at a ratio of 4 wells per tube.\r\n\n\n2 Centrifuge at 600g for 6 min to pellet. Remove the supernatant, and add approximately 150μL Advanced DMEM F12 to each tube. Pipette up and down 300 times through a small bore pipette tip to break up the organoids and the Matrigel. Do not use excessive force. An electronic pipetter with a ‘mix’ function and its uptake volume set to 150µL is recommended for this step.\r\n\n\n3 Add 1ml Advanced DMEM F12 and centrifuge at 600g for 6 min. Remove supernatant. Add 150 uL Advanced DMEM F12 and pipette up and down manually a further 80 times using moderate force. \r\n\n\n4 Add 1ml Advanced DMEM F12 and centrifuge at 600g for 6 min. Remove supernatant. The pellet at this stage should contain very little Matrigel.  If Matrigel is still present, estimate the volume. Flick the tubes to re-suspend the pellets. Place tubes on ice.\r\n\n\n5 Working with one tube at a time, add ice-cold Matrigel, mix gently and replace the tube on ice. Allow 20-25 µL Matrigel per well to be plated, minus the estimated volume of any residual Matrigel which remained in the pellet.  Pool organoids together and mix gently to distribute them evenly throughout the Matrigel.\r\n\n\n6 Dispense 20-25 µL drops carefully onto the centre of the growth area of wells of a 48-well culture plate, taking care not to create bubbles.\r\n\n\n7 Place the culture plate in the incubator for 15 min to allow Matrigel to set.\r\n\n\n8 Add 250µl expansion medium to each well.\r\n\n\n9 Replace medium every 2-3 d. Passage every 7-10 d as appropriate."

Replace with 250 µL Cell Recovery Solution \\(Corning) and place the plate on ice for 60 min.\r\n\n\n2 Pool contents of wells into low-binding Eppendorf tubes using low-retention pipette tips. Centrifuge at 600g for 6 min to pellet organoids. \r\n\n\n3 Remove supernatant and add 200 µL Advanced DMEM F12 to each tube. Manually pipette gently up and down 80 times with moderate force to partially disrupt organoids. Add 1ml Advanced DMEM F12 and centrifuge again.\r\n\n\n4 Remove supernatant and flick pellets to re-suspend. Place on ice.\r\n\n\n5 Add 0.5-1 mL Recovery cell culture freezing medium \\(Life Technologies) to each tube with gentle mixing and transfer contents to labelled cryovials on ice. Transfer immediately to ‘Mr. Frosty’ or similar cell freezing vessel at minus 80⁰c overnight, then to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage."
