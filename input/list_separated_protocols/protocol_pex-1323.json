    "\n<p>The study will integrate gamification techniques using Kinect Azure and Oculus Quest (i.e., virtual reality) with entrepreneur samples, to evaluate their impact on improving markers of well-being and performance. We will utilize VR gamification interventions to explore their differential implications for subjective health among entrepreneurs, using three groups, with random assignment experiments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Inclusion criteria include:</p><p><br></p><p>The participant’s age is 18 years or older.</p><p>They can understand or fluently speak Hindi or English;&nbsp;</p><p>They are willing and able to give informed consent to participate in the trial.</p><p><br></p><p>Exclusion criteria include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They have physical disabilities, which make using the interventions difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>They have self-reported serious psychological or medical disabilities that hinder with the interventions.</p><p>They have neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, stroke or dementia).</p><p>They have significant visual, auditory or balance impairment.</p><p>They are currently participating in another intensive psychological therapy (or will begin during the timeframe of the 4-week trial therapy).</p><p>They have a primary diagnosis of alcohol (or substance) disorder or personality disorder.</p><p>They are unable to watch VR videos (e.g., blindness).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Eligible participants will receive oral and written information about the study from researchers. Principle investigator will answer their queries regarding the study through phone or email. After scheduling the first appointment, we will send the questionnaires to the interested entrepreneurs to complete at home. In their first interview, they will bring the questionnaires with them. The questionnaires and interviews are identical for the three groups. The only exception is for the control group, where the questions about the VR platform are not relevant, thus omitted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Intervention</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Kinect and Oculus Quest are portable immersive VR devices for gamification. This study will examine the interventions for over 4 weeks. We will give the participants the devices and trained how to use their device independently. We will give the participants a 30 minutes daily gamification module at the HuMen research lab, DMIMS DU to play games on either Kinect or Oculus quest. We will assign them for 3-days per week for a complete 4-week gamification program. We will provide the questionnaires for evaluating entrepreneurship stress, burnout, quality of life, and performance at the start of the program and every last day of the training week. They will complete the questionnaires at the start of the gamification session. We will use 'Kinect Azure' and 'Oculus quest' to implement gamification or serious games among the participants. A specially tailored program or a Kinect game comprising 'measured doses' of several exergame titles, will target the three dimensions of fitness and wellbeing- Physical, mental/cognitive, and psychological/emotional wellbeing <sup>19</sup>. The Azure Kinect games to be used in the prospective research are Fruit ninja, Just dance 2020, FIFA 15, Your shape and Brave. In Oculus Quest, we will incorporate the games such as Moss, Beat sabre and Tetris effect.</p><p><br></p><p>Control&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Control group will maintain the level of physical activity similar to that before enrolment into the trial. They will maintain their daily routine. They will attend the testing sessions at the baseline, T1, T2, T3, and T4.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Outcomes measures</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Primary outcome measures:</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>For Entrepreneurial stress</strong></p><p>After studies by Fatoki (2019), Wei et al. (2015) and Fernet et al. (2016), we will measure the stressors of entrepreneurial employment using five items <sup>20–22</sup>. Its five items relate to workload, competition, knowledge, responsibility, and resources. Five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) will measure the responses on entrepreneurial stress. Higher scores will show more stress in the participant.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For Burnout</strong></p><p>A short version of the burnout measuring scale (BMS) developed by Malach-Pines (2005) will measure burnout <sup>20,23</sup>. The BMS includes 10 items (tired, disappointed with people, hopeless, trapped, helpless, depressed, physically weak, worthless/like a failure, difficulties sleeping, a feeling of ‘I’ve had it'). The items assess the level of an individual's physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion. The Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always) will assess the physical, mental and emotional exhaustion of entrepreneurs. The final score that ranges between 1 and 7 is calculated by dividing the total score by",
    {
        "title": "10.",
        "body": "The BMS scale is one-dimensional. The overall sum score assesses burnout as this single score is easy to interpret, although the BMS distinguishes between mental, emotional and physical exhaustion <sup>20,24</sup>. This means that the scale provides a unique score of burnout associated with an individual. The mean score of 4 shows a critical threshold at which an individual feels burnout. A score of lower than 2.4 points shows a very low burnout. A score of between 2.5 and 3.4 points shows low burnout. A score of between 3.5 and 4.4 points shows burnout. A score of between 4.5 and 5.4 points shows high exposure to burnout. A score of above 5.5 points shows very high exposure to burnout. This requires the implementation of a plan to assist the burnt-out individual <sup>23</sup>. Studies have shown very satisfactory psychometric properties of the BMS short version scale <sup>20</sup>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For Performance</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We will measure performance either objectively or subjectively. The objective measure includes obtaining actual figures on profit and sales. Many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are unwilling to provide these figures <sup>20</sup>. The performance is subjectively measured using satisfaction with growth in sales and profit <sup>25</sup>. Five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not at all satisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied) was used to measure satisfaction with performance.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For Quality of Life</strong></p><p>SF-12 measures 8 health domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health <sup>26</sup>. Physical functioning covers limitations in daily life because of health problems. The role of physical scale measures role limitations because of physical health problems. The bodily pain scale assesses pain frequency and pain interference with usual roles <sup>26</sup>. The general health scale measures individual perceptions of general health. The vitality scale assesses energy levels and fatigue. The social functioning scale measures the extent to which ill health interferes with social activities. The role of emotional scale assesses role limitations because of emotional problems, and the mental health scale measures psychological distress <sup>26</sup>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Secondary outcomes:</strong></p><p><strong>Pre-training and post-training questionnaire</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Before the training session, each participant will complete a pre-training questionnaire to explore past technology and gaming experience and measure the confidence levels with new technology. After the training session, the participants will complete a post-training questionnaire to assess their level of confidence using the VR platform and to explore how the participant may be using the device in the weeks that follow.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Post-intervention questionnaire</strong></p><p>We will conduct a post-intervention questionnaire after completion of the intervention period to assess the participant’s perception of the VR platform and its components.</p><p><br></p>"
