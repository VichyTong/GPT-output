        "body": "Phosphopeptide ligation with a carrier protein to generate ligated phosphoprotein \\(LPP) substrates\r\n  • Timing, 4-16 h \r\n\n\nAn intein mediated protein ligation \\(IPL) reaction is conducted by mixing the carrier protein \\(CP) and phosphopeptide \\(T3pThr, or Cdc2pTyr) in a molar ratio of at least 1:25 \\(CP: peptide). The reaction is usually carried out at 4°C for 16 h or at 25°C for 4 h, with ligation efficiencies typically in the range of 40%-75% when using purified peptides possessing an N-terminal cysteine.  This extent of ligation usually requires the synthetic peptide to be present at a final concentration of 0.5-1.0 mM. The ligation reaction is evaluated by a shift of mobility of the LPP compared to the unligated CP on a Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE. Peptides can be stored in a powder form or as a stock solution \\(5-10 mM) at -80 °C. The excess of unligated free peptide can be removed by dialysis using a nitrocellulose filter or a Slide-a-lyzer. For a large scale purification of LPP, gel filtration or chromatography can be performed. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLigation Protocol\r\n\n\n  2 X Peptide Solution \\(2 mM)  12.5 μl\r\n\n\n  10 X Carrier Protein Reaction Buffer 2.5 μl\r\n\n\n  Carrier Protein \\(1.0 mg/mL)  10.0 μl\r\n\n\n   Total volume                25.0 μl\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPAUSE POINT Ligation products can be stored at –20 °C for up to one month or –80 °C for at least 6 months."
