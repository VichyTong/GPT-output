Take care that the humidity inside the incubator is always between 45-55% by controlling with a hygrometer. Let the incubator run for 24 h before starting the incubation.\r\n    CRITICAL STEP: Place the incubator in a distance of at least 50 cm from the ground to avoid infections. Do not place it near heaters; protect it from strong direct sunlight and other sources of heat. Leave the space around the ventilation windows free to ensure a proper air circulation."

Consider, that when the eggs are delivered, they might have been already stored for some days and therefore the incubation should immediately start. If it is not possible to use the eggs immediately, store them at a temperature between 8-12°C. Storage for longer than 1 day is not recommended because it may result in higher embryonic mortality. \r\n\n\n  CRITICAL STEP: Wear sterile gloves all the time during handling the eggs to minimize the risk of infection. However, it is not necessary to handle the eggs under a sterile hood."

Thus, calculate 20% more eggs per group than needed for statistically relevant results."

We determined that for the xenotransplantation of pancreatic cancer cells the EDD 9 is optimal. However, in the literature also earlier time points are described starting at EDD6 onwards. \r\n\n\n  OPTIONAL: Two days prior to xenotransplantation, you may lipofect the tumor cells in vitro with 50 nm of miR-NC and let-7c mimics, while the control cells remain untreated.
