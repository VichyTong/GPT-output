            "LNA DIG labelled probes:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n Probes were purchased labelled with digoxigenin at 5’ and 3’ \\(25 µM). Probes were diluted and stored according to published protocol 18 and manufactures instruction. Pre-hybridizations and hybridizations were performed at temperature 20-25°C below the Tm of the given LNA probe. Working conditions and the efficiency of the in situ hybridizations were determined by using both positive \\(U6, miRNA known to be ubiquitously expressed in most of the tissues) and negative \\(scramble, has no homology to any known miRNA/ mRNA sequence) control probes\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHybridization Mix 10ml: \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAccording to published protocol 18 \\(To 1.8 ml DEPC-treated water add 5ml of ultra pure 50% formamide, 2.5ml of 20x SSC, 500μl of 10 ug/μl yeast t-RNA, 200 μl of 50x Denhardt’s solution for a total volume of 10ml. Divide into aliquots and keep at -20°C. The hybridization buffer has a pH of 6-6.5.
