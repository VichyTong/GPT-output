Assemble the glass plates with spacers and secure with bull clips on each side \\(Fig. 1A,B). Heat 1 % agarose in microwave to liquefy.  Seal gel plate assembly with 1 % agarose to avoid leakage when pouring the gel \\(Fig. 1):  Holding the gel plates at a steep angle, pipet small amounts \\(about 1ml) of 1 % agarose in-between the plates so that it flows along the spacer towards the bottom of the gel \\(Fig. 1C).  Once the agarose reaches the bottom, reverse the angle of the gel so the agarose covers as much of the bottom as possible \\(Fig. 1D).  Keeping the gel in the reverse angle, add again agarose in-between the plates so that it flows along the other spacer \\(Fig. 1E), and as soon as the agarose reaches the bottom, swap the angle of the gel so that the agarose again covers as much of the bottom part as possible \\(Fig. 1F)."
