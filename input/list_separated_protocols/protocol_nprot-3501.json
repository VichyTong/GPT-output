However, sample loss is much higher when the isolated cell number is insufficient for the formation of a visible pellet and thus, rarer cell types can be sorted and stored directly in the nuclear isolation buffer that will be used later during micrococcal nuclease \\(MNase) digestion of chromatin \\("
