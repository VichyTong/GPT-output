            "_Cell culture_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProteome-derived peptide libraries can be generated from any proteome source with known genome or proteome sequence, such as human or murine cell lines. Prokaryotic cell lines are less suited since they represent lower sequence diversity. We have used the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 in monolayer culture and the 293 human embryonic kidney cell line in suspension culture using the chemically defined, protein-free CD 293 medium \\(Invitrogen). In order to produce sufficient starting material for several subsite screening assays, we recommend to harvest cell material from at least 6 cell culture flasks of 175 cm<sup>2</sup> surface each. When using serum-supplemented medium, cells are grown serum-free when reaching 50 % confluency. Cells are washed three times in phosphate buffered saline \\(PBS) \\(138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) and grown in serum-free medium for 12−24 h. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Proteome harvest_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCell-conditioned medium, cell lysate, and detergent-solubilized lysis pellet can be used to generate proteome-derived peptide libraries. In our experience and using the cell strains described above, cell lysate and detergent-solubilized lysis pellet result in markedly higher library yields than cell conditioned medium. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Library preparation from cell-conditioned medium_",
