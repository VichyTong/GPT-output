We estimate adjusted EV mean concentration or EV geometric mean concentration as appropriate. For each size, from 30nm to 700nm, we compare the EV mean differences between groups. Due to the high number of comparisons, we apply a multiple comparison method based on Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) to calculate the FDR P-value. Results are reported as a series graph for EV mean concentrations of each size by group and vertical bar charts to represent the size-specific p-values obtained comparing groups. For all the graphs, X-axis is the size of EVs. In Figure 2 we report an example of this analysis.</p>"
