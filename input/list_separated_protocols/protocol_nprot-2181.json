During the procedure, the heart rate decreases from <sub>300 to </sub>50 bpm but recovers to baseline within 30 sec of clamp release. Ventricular pressure returns to baseline within 60 sec."

NOTE Pretreatment of the animals with either adenosine or serotonin by injecting a solution containing 1–10 μM into the inferior vena cava can also be used. This induces increased permeability of the capillaries, resulting in enhanced attachment of the viruses to myocardial cells. \r\n\n\n\\!\\! NOTE In a further refinement of this method, clamping of the aorta, pulmonary artery, and superior and inferior vena cava has been performed by tying the superior vena cava, pulmonary artery, and aorta with one 5-0 silk suture compressed with a small hollow tube. A similar compression is achieved for the inferior vena cava."
