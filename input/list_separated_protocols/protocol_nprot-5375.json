The fastest way to produce these baits is by synthesizing full-length constructs \\(both WT and mut versions) and afterwards using PCR amplification to append it to pMICBD1 and to extract truncated baits for the control panel. Final constructs can be incorporated in pMICBD1 plasmid either by endonuclease cut/ligation or by Gibson Assembly \\("
