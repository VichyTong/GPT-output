    "\nA) Surface sterilization of seeds\r\n\n\n1|Place seeds in sterile 50 ml plastic tubes and add approximately 35–40 ml sodium hypochlorite.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP The seeds must be inbred line \\(self-fertilized for 8 generation at least). Pollen contamination results in phenotype and genotype interferences to the genes.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP Do not exceed approximately 4–5 ml seeds per tube. Larger amount of seeds per tube results in incomplete surface sterilization.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP Seeds should be surface sterilized completely to avoid contamination by microorganisms and fungi. \r\n\n\n2|Close the tube tightly and shake vigorously at room temperature \\(RT, 22–25 °C) for 20 min.",
