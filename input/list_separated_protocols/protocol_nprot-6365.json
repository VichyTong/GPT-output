This new monomer library, which defines the moieties of the chemical modifications of the rRNA, can be used for atomic model refinement using PHENIX and also this should be imported into Coot for the model building. In order to maintain the geometry of the O3’-P/P-O3’ bonds, as for standard nucleotide libraries, the “data_mod_list” and “data_link_p” records corresponding to DNA/RNA residues need to be added to the new monomer library. In addition, while building the atomic model, these newly built modified monomers were linked with covalent bonds to the canonical nucleic acid residues present in the atomic model with the following steps:",

In X-ray crystallography, this also helps to account for the whole content of ordered molecules in the crystal and optimize the model fit with regards to the experimental diffraction amplitudes. In cryo-EM maps the model to data comparison is done locally and in real space.\r\n\n\nAfter fitting the ribosomal proteins and RNA chains to the density map, a significant number of residual densities near the ribosomal proteins and RNA chains were found; these possibly corresponded to water molecules and magnesium ions. Discrimination of magnesium ions from the water molecules involved systematic inspection of the residual density in the cryo-EM map, analysis of the proper coordination and the hydrogen bond potentials \\(angle and distance). Magnesium ions were identified manually based on the coordination geometry, chemical environment and electron density distribution. Typical Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions adopt hexa-coordination with octahedral geometry and the interatomic distance between Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and the neighbouring atoms varies between 1.85 and 2.3 Å with a bond angle close to 90º. Moreover, keeping in mind that the hydrated radius of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is substantially larger, some peaks were annotated with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, although they do not possess nearest neighbors for typical coordination. On the other hand, residual densities found at an environment with hydrogen bond geometry with the nearest polar atoms were annotated as water molecules."
