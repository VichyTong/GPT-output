Schöler and H.Th. Marc Timmers \\(2013). A central role for TFIID in the pluripotent transcription circuitry. Nature, in press.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 1\r\n\n\n• Plate 293T cells into 10 cm dishes \\(4 dishes per virus) in a final volume of 9 ml MEF medium per dish. Plate enough cells to obtain 70% confluence on the next day \r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nDay 2\r\n\n\n• Transfect the 293T cells from day 1 \\(cells should look 70% confluent, nicely spread, evenly distributed, without clumps) with Fugene 6 \\(Promega) as follows:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPerform for each virus a separate transfection. \r\n\n\nUse for 4 dishes \\(this will yield 1000 μl virus after concentration)\r\n\n\nTube 1: 328 μl Optimem with 72 μl Fugene 6 \r\n\n\nTube 2: In a total volume of 400 μl Optimem: \r\n\n\n12 μg LV-OSKM or LV-gene of interest\r\n\n\n8 μg psPAX2\r\n\n\n4 μg pCMV-VSVG\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIncubate both tubes for 5 minutes at room temperature.  Add tube 2 to tube 1, mix gently by flicking and incubate 15 minutes at room temperature. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAdd 200 μl of the mixture per 10cm dish, shake and incubate for 72 hours. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 4\r\n\n\n• Plate F134 human embryonic fibroblasts at 100,000 cells per well in a 6 wells plate in MEF medium \\(the dish does not need to be gelatinzed). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 5 \r\n\n\n• Collect supernatant of dishes with transfected 293T cells and filter through 0.45 μm PVDF filters. Spin filtered supernatant by ultra-centrifugation at 20 krpm in an SW32Ti rotor \\(Beckman) for 2 hr at 4 °C. Remove supernatant by decanting and dissolve the pellet into 1000 μl DMEM low glucose. Use the virus directly to infect cells or store virus for less than 1 week at 4 °C or for longer periods in aliquots at -80 °C. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: When virus production was efficient a white/brown pellet will appear after ultra centrifugation \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n• Infect the plated F134 cells from Day 4 with 50 μl of concentrated OSKM virus and 50 μl of the concentrated virus expressing the gene of interest. Add to each well 6 µg/ml protamine sulfate directly into the medium and mix by swirling.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: use titration of the amount of OSKM virus to determine the optimal amount of virus that gives a moderate amount of iPS colonies to allow for testing enhancers of reprogramming efficiency. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 6\r\n\n\n• Replace medium of the infected F134 cells by washing three times with PBS followed by MEF medium \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: is is also possible to perform this step one day later.\r\n\n\nOptimal: Check after washing fluorescent signal of tomato red.  48 hours after infection, a light tomato red signal should appear in at least 40 % of the cells. After a couple of days this signal will increase.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 10\r\n\n\n• Plate CF-1 MEF feeder cells with 1,7 x 10e4 cells per cm2 into a gelatinized 6 wells plate. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNote: these feeders will be used for 13 days. It is therefore important not to plate the feeders earlier than day",
