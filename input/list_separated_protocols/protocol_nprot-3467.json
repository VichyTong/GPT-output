Collect sample in a sterile tube and immediately snap-freeze it in liquid \r\n\n\nnitrogen \\(on site). Immediate cryofixation of the sample is a key step in the experimental workflow to prevent any modification of the information contained within the DNA, RNA, protein and metabolite fractions. Biomolecular fractions are known to rapidly change due to specific and non-specific degradation, regulation of gene expression, and post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications.\r\n\n\nA.2. Preserve the sample at -80 °C until pre-processing. \r\n\n\nA.3. With a sterile spatula, reduce the sample to powder form \\(or very small pieces) around 200 mg +/- 10 % of frozen sample. To preserve the frozen state of the sample, cool down all equipment and refreeze regularly the material, by briefly dipping it into liquid nitrogen. Float a weighing boat on the surface of the liquid nitrogen and pour the powdered sample into this. \r\n\n\nA.4. Transfer the frozen sample into a pre-cooled 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and refreeze this briefly in a liquid nitrogen bath. Optionally, the weighed sample can be stored for few days at -80 °C until further processing."

Thaw the sample on ice for approximately 10-15 min by placing the sample tube horizontally on the ice surface. Flip the tube regularly and verify the consistency of the sample every few minutes. Avoid further warming by placing the thawed sample tube in ice immediately once the sample is completely thawed. \r\n\n\nB.2. Centrifuge the thawed samples at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant into a fresh 2 ml sterile tube pre-cooled to 4 °C. If visible particles are still present in the supernatant, carry out an additional centrifugation for 5 min until a completely limpid supernatant is obtained.
