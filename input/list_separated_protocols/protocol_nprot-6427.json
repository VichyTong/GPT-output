Therefore, the cells never grow in the absence of EB1 function. The disadvantage is that shRNA is never complete, and cell-to-cell variability and remaining protein may add to experimental noise. The π-EB1 construct has silent mutations that renders it resistant to the shRNA used. We describe the procedure we used for H1299 cells; for other cell types the protocol may need to be adjusted.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nH1299 cells are cultured in RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep, 1x NEAA in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> / 37°C.

It works well to use the EGFP signal to find cells and focus, but the signal will not appear localized to MT ends. To see EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C on MT plus ends, one has to wait for at least 30 s to allow for π-EB1 re-association before acquiring an image. The half-life of EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C dissociation from MT ends is ~200 ms, so it is also important to keep the exposure time short to minimize π-EB1 photo-dissociation during image aquisition. Because blue light excited GFPs cannot be used for live imaging without inactivating π-EB1, we mostly use it as marker for generating cell lines, and as a control that π-EB1 photo-dissociation works as expected. For live cell imaging of other proteins \\(e.g. other +TIPs) before or during blue light inactivation we recommend using red fluorescent proteins such as mCherry.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n• Seed promising clones onto 6 cm dishes at 30% confluency"

In this case, the procedure could be adapted to CRISP/Cas9 knockout a protein of interest in a cell line expressing a π-variant protein already, in which gRNA target sites are mutated similar to the shRNA strategy described above.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSince there are many available CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing protocols, we only describe some of the specific details of the approach we took to knockout our genes of interest. For CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout we used the gRNA/pSpCAS9\\(BB)-2a-GFP \\(Addgene #48138) plasmid described previously<sup>5</sup>.

In our case this was possible because there are only one EB1 and EB3 transcript each. When targeting a gene for which multiple transcripts exist, it is advisable to target the first common exon. gRNAs were identified using the \"Zhang lab website\":http://crispr.mit.edu/ and by scanning the coding sequence for exon 1 of EB1 for gRNA binding sites.

        "body": "• Prepare 5x Pre-Assembly buffer: 0.5 M Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM of each dNTP, 50 mM DTT, 25% PEG-8000.\r\n\n\n• Prepare 400 µl of 2x Assembly Master Mix by mixing \r\n\n\n160 μl of Pre-Assembly buffer\r\n\n\n0.3 μl T5 exonuclease \\(10 units/μl)\r\n\n\n10 μl of Phusion polymerase \\(2 units/μl)\r\n\n\n230 μl dH<sub>2</sub>O.\r\n\n\n• Prepare 10 μl aliquots in 0.2 ml PCR tubes and store at -20°C. Use 1 aliquot per Gibson assembly reaction.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n• Thaw one 10 μl aliquot of the 2x Assembly Master Mix on ice\r\n\n\n• Add 50-100 ng of linearized plasmid, and add inserts at a 2:1 molar ratio \\(to the linearized plasmid, e.g. 100 ng of a 5000 bp plasmid, plus 40 ng of a 1000 bp insert). Add dH<sub>2</sub>O to a 20 μl final volume. Mix well.\r\n\n\n• Place the tube in PCR Thermal cycler and incubate for 1 hour at 50°C.\r\n\n\n• Transform and analyze Miniprep DNA from 5-10 colonies."
