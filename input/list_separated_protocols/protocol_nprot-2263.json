"\n<div><p><b>Modification of the PDMS surfaces</b></p><p><b>1</b>&#9474; Clean flat PDMS surfaces: first with ethanol 96% and then with DI H<sub>2</sub>O. <b>? TROUBLESHOOTING. </b>Flat PDMS surfaces are used for aneasier characterization of the resulting modifications.</p><p><b>2</b>&#9474; Create hydroxyl groups on the PDMS surface. Select the appropriate chemistry protocol:</p><p>A. Modification with PEG: immerse the PDMS in a 1 mg/ml PEG solution in DI H<sub>2</sub>O. Leave to react for 1 hour. Then rinse with DI H<sub>2</sub>Oand dry with N<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>B. Modification with PVA: immerse the PDMS in a 1 mg/ml PVA solution in DI H<sub>2</sub>O. Leave to react for 1 hour. Then rinse with DI H<sub>2</sub>Oand dry with N<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>C. Chemical oxidation: immerse the PDMS in an acidic solution containing DI H<sub>2</sub>O, 37% HCl and 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in a 5:1:1\\(v/v/v) ratio<sup>18</sup>. Then rinse with DI H<sub>2</sub>O and dry with N<sub>2</sub>. <b>? TROUBLESHOOTING. </b>This step can generate bubbles onthe PDMS surface. Try to avoid them as far as possible by stirring the media.<b> \\! CAUTION </b>Avoid the HCl vapors by carrying out this step in a fumehood. Use gloves, since apart from the acidic conditions of the liquid mixture, a direct contact with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could lead to awhitish irritating skin color.</p><p><b>3</b>&#9474; Create aldehyde groups on the PDMS surface by incubating them in a 99.5% ethanol solution containing 2% TESU and 2% TEA for 1 hour. Then rinsewith 99.5% ethanol and dry them at 80&#186;C for 2 hours. <b>\\! CAUTION </b>Avoid the vapors coming from TEA by preparing the solution mix in a fumehood.<b> ? TROUBLESHOOTING.</b> This step should be done in a closed container and using enough solvent to avoid the total evaporation of the liquid.It should be carried out in an inert atmosphere like nitrogen or argon without humidity presence.</p><p><b>&#9608; PAUSE POINT </b>After this step, systems can be stored overnight at 4&#186;C in carbonate buffer pH 8.</p><p><b>Characterization of the modified PDMS surfaces </b></p><p><b>4 |</b>Measure the contact angle with a contact angle meter: deposit a drop of water on the modified PDMS surfaces and compare the angle formed between thedrop and the surface to the angle formed using a non-modified PDMS surface. Make several drops and calculate the mean value of the angle and itsstandard deviation. <b>? TROUBLESHOOTING.</b> Try to always use the same drop size. Try to obtain pictures with a high contrast to facilitate theautomatic detection of the drop shape by the software of the contact angle meter. There should only appear one drop in each picture acquired by thecamera. If there are more drops, the software could understand that the other drops form part of the drop that should be detected.</p><p><b>5 |</b>Make an XPS analysis of the modified and non-modified PDMS surfaces. Use a monochromatized Al K&#945; source or similar \\(1486.6 eV). Deconvolute thesignals using a weighted sum of Lorentzian and Gaussian component curves after background subtraction.</p><b>6 |</b><p>Obtain topographic and phase images by using an atomic force microscopy in tapping mode. In this mode, the cantilever oscillates up and down at itsresonance frequency. The interaction between the tip and the surface when they come close causes a decrease of the oscillation amplitude, and thecontrol system changes the height of the cantilever to maintain this amplitude constant. In phase images, changes in phase oscillations giveinformation about the different type of materials that can be found on the surface. Topographic images give information about the surface roughness.</p><b> ? TROUBLESHOOTING</b><p>Try to avoid an excess of contact between the tip and the surface because PDMS is a soft material and its deformation caused by the tip could appear inthe pictures as noise. By contrast, if the distance between the surface and the tip is too large, a flat surface could be recorded.</p><br/></div>"
