Use a compact laser power meter to monitor the alignment result of each optical component. Couple the object beam of the laser interferometer into a custom-built microscope. Use the carrier signal level to monitor the optical sensitivity of the system when the object beam was focused on a low reflective \\(~0.0001%) surface. Minimize the noise floor of the instrument by maximizing the carrier signal level. For scanning measurements of the basilar membrane vibration, the transparency of the perilymph in the optical path significantly affects the carrier signal level and the noise floor. Blood cells suspended in the perilymph often prevent the interferometer from detecting the basilar membrane vibration. Thus minimize bleeding and avoid blood cells entering the cochlea."
