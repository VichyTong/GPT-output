Incubate for 10 min at 37° C with the cell-impermeable tetrazine-dye diluted to the final concentration of 0.5-2.5 µM in PBS. ATTO488-tz dye works well for labeling in fixed cells, although with a higher non-specific background staining in comparison to live cell labeling with cell-permeable dyes. Aspirate the dye, rinse 3x with PBS and incubate with PBS on a shaker at RT for 20-30 min. Keep at 4° C until immunocytochemistry staining or microscopy.</p><p><strong>II.

Aspirate 200 µl of the medium from each well and add 250 µl of fresh warm NB Plus + medium.
