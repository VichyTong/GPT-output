If starting with a library of sequences, generate a set of 3D homology-models using comparative-modeling software, such as SWISS-MODEL \\(http://swissmodel.expasy.org/SWISS-MODEL.html, Modeller \\(http://www.salilab.org/modeller/), etc. NOTE: The performance of the algorithm is partly dependent on the resolution of the input structures, and better results will be obtained using high quality structural data or homology models. Homology models should be constructed with high quality templates \\(e.g. X-ray structures) and checked for errors using software such as WHATCHECK \\[4]."
