In addition, “mock-transfect”cells with PBS in order to measure the background luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. This Elk-1 reporter system is based on a hybrid fusion protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and the transactivation domain of Elk-1 that binds via its Gal4 moiety to the pG5E4D38–Luc plasmid and drives the transcription of the luciferase gene only if it is phosphorylated by ERK within its Elk-1 moiety \\(Kortenjann et al, 1994)."

        "body": "For the measurement of transcriptional NFAT:AP-1 activity, transfect BMMCs with 1 μg pCMVβ and 3.5 μg of the NFAT reporter plasmid pNFAT-Luc \\(kindly provided by Dr. Gerald Crabtree, Stanford University, Stanford, USA) as described above. This NFAT reporter carries three tandem copies of the distal NFAT:AP-1 composite element of the human IL-2 promotor \\(Durand et al, 1988), which were cloned upstream of the minimal IL-2 promotor \\(from position -89 to +51) and the luciferase reporter gene. Consequently, this reporter is only transactivated when both NFAT and AP-1 are present in the nucleus and assembled to a ternary complex \\(Fiering et al, 1990; Macian et al., 2001). This widely used reporter plasmid responds to all known NFAT family members and can be activated in a NFAT-dependent manner in a variety of cell types.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4.Following transfection with reporter plasmids, plate BMMCs in 3 mL culture medium \\(RPMI 1640 medium \\(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum \\(HyClone), 100 μg each of penicillin and streptomycin per mL, 2mM L-glutamine \\(Life Technologies), 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% HEPES and 5 ng/mL of recombinant murine IL-3 \\(Peprotech)) and allow to recover for 24 h. Then sensitise with 100 ng/mL anti-DNP IgE antibodies for 18 hours. Subsequently, split the cells and either stimulate with 20 ng/mL DNP-HSA for 6 h \\(Elk-1) or 8 h \\(NFAT:AP-1) or leave untreated. Following stimulation, lyse the cells in luciferase lysis buffer \\(Promega) and determine the raw luciferase activities using a luciferase activity kit \\(Promega). As an internal control for transfection efficiency, measure the β-galactosidase \\(β-gal) activities using Galactostar and Galacton reagents \\(Tropix). The background β-gal activity of mock-transfected cells should be subtracted from the lysates of transfected BMMCs and the relative β-gal activity of each sample was calculated. In order to obtain the standardised luciferase activity, divide the luciferase activity of each sample by the corresponding relative β-gal activity."
