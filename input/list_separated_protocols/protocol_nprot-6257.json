    "\n_General considerations:_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ability to determine de novo synthesized \\(s<sup>4</sup>U labeled) transcripts by SLAMseq will depend on \\(1) the cellular s<sup>4</sup>U uptake kinetics, labeling time and s<sup>4</sup>U concentration, \\(2) the overall transcriptional activity of the cell type and \\(3) the library sequencing depth. These parameters need to be taken into account when designing a SLAMseq experiment, particularly when employing short s<sup>4</sup>U pulse labeling, where sequencing depth demands adjustments to the given cellular parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe highly recommend testing optimal concentrations of s<sup>4</sup>U for the cell line of interest by assessing cellular toxicity \\(e.g. using CellTiterGlo® Luminescent Cell Viability assay, Promega after manufacturer’s instructions) and s<sup>4</sup>U incorporation rates \\(e.g. by HPLC, see below) prior to the sequencing experiment in order to meet s<sup>4</sup>U -labeling conditions that do not affect gene expression or cellular viability. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

SNP positions and read positions with a low base quality value are automatically excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final output of SLAM-DUNK reports for each transcript the genomic coordinates and the UTR region, the T content of the UTR region, the number of mapped reads \\(raw counts and norm. counts), the number of T>C conversion-containing reads, the coverage over T positions, the T>C conversion rate, and the number of multimapping reads."
