In equation 1, \\[T]<sub>tot</sub> and \\[DNA]<sub>tot</sub> are the total concentrations of the target and DNA, respectively; A<sub>1</sub> is the area of the peak of free DNA divided by the migration time of free DNA, A<sub>2</sub> is the area of the peak of DNA that dissociated from the complex during NECEEM divided by the migration time of free DNA and A<sub>3</sub> is the area of the peak of the intact complex that reached the detector divided by the migration time of the complex. EC<sub>50</sub> is a measure of an effective abundance of aptamers in the library, which is used for qualitatively monitoring the progress of selection — a decrease of this value throughout the steps of partitioning indicates that the selection is progressing. The division of areas by corresponding migration times is performed to ensure that peak areas are proportional to the amounts of the species. This procedure is necessary for CE instruments with the on-column detection mode only. For CE instruments with past-column detection, normalization by time is not required.
