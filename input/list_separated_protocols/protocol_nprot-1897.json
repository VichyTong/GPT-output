For sensitive nanodevices that can potentially detect the elementary charge, this extrinsic noise can hide the target signal. Therefore, the noise contribution of each connected equipment to the electrical measurement system should be carrefully investigated. For example, vacuum pumps or temperature controllers may increase 50 Hz noise amplitude. We consider that 50 Hz noise amplitude is reasonable if \\(SIxΔf)^0.5<0.1%xId, where SI is the power spectrum current peak noise, Δf~1.5 Hz is the 50 Hz peak bandwidth and Id the drain DC current."
