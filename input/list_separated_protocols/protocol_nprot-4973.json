"\n- Cut aluminum foil 5N in order to obtain a final and rectangular shape dimension of 1.5 cm x 1 cm. \r\n\n\n- Cut the template with a knife by using careful attention in order to avoid curvature and mechanical stress effects on the aluminum surface. The two electrodes should have same dimension and shape. \r\n\n\n- Rinse aluminum foil with acetone to degrease the surface. \r\n\n\n- Perform an annealing of aluminum in a vacuum stove at 420Â°C for 3 hours to increase aluminium ductility and template was immersing in an electrolytic bath. \r\n\n\n- Activate aluminum before treatment to remove an inert layer oxide on the surface and in more detail clean with a solution of perchloric acid 7% \\(V/V) with a second-electrode of aluminum in a controlled thermostatic bath by using a mixture of ace and salts.\r\n\n\n- Perform the first step of anodization using a voltage of 40 V for 1 hour. \r\n\n\n- Connect aluminum and platinum sheets to each electrode with inert clips.\r\n\n\n- Immerse both in a oxalic acid solution 0.3 M. \r\n\n\n- Add ethylene glycol to increase the conductibility of solution in quantity of 2% \\(V/V) referred to a final volume of 100 mL.\r\n\n\n- Agitate with a magnetic stirrer at 1000 rpm/min to disperse heating around the electrode. The current density of solution changes its value during electrolytic processes.\r\n\n\n- Sonicate the layer of aluminium foil at the end of the first step for 5 min in a bath of ethanol to remove traces of oxalic acid. \r\n\n\n- Also during the second and final step traces of oxalic acid remain incorporated within the pores wall.\r\n\n\n- Remove disorganized layer of anodic porous alumina by etching with a solution of phosphoric/chromic acid. \r\n\n\n- Perform the second step of anodization at 40 V for 5 hours with the electrode inter distance fixed at 1 cm. \r\n\n\n- At the end of the second step, rinse alumina with Milli-Q water and with a lower clean airflow. \r\n\n\n- Put the layer thus obtained was putin a stove under vacuum with humidity control over night. \r\n\n\n- Spot on the electrolyzed aluminum surface by using micro-contact mode technique with a pen tips by a robot.\r\n\n\n- Store the sample in a refrigerator system. \r\n\n\n- Deposit a plasmid gel on the surface by an automatized system by micro-contact . On the surface of anodic porous alumina spotted with a gel plasmids was following the sequence describe in the Invitrogen kit and is here summarized."
