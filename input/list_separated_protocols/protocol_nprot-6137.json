The mode of extraction is not very important, and there is no need to take steps to prevent DNA shearing \\(as the first step of the protocol involves shearing the DNA using sonication). We routinely use a protocol \\(4) that combines chemical, physical, and enzymatic lysis steps to maximize the representation of various community members \\(keeping in mind that unlysed cells will not release DNA into the solution and hence will not be represented in the final community profile).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA.
