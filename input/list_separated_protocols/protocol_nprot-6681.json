When calculating the means and standard deviations that contribute to these metrics, the ‘tier 1’ species that lack any genes \\(in a family) are taken into account, as follows. First, to calculate the mean and standard deviation for a whole family \\(e.g. for _C<sub>v</sub>_), we identify the node of the species tree corresponding to the root of the gene tree for the family. Then, for each tier 1 descendent species that is present on the species tree but not in the current gene family, we count its summed protein length as zero when calculating the mean and standard deviation. Similarly, when calculating the means and standard deviations for a particular clade \\(for _Z<sub>max</sub>_ or _E<sub>max</sub>_), the node of the species tree corresponding to the root of the clade is identified, and all tier 1 species that descend from that node of the species tree are taken into account.\r\n  \r\n\n\nThe code for calculating metrics is tied to our in-house infrastructure, but is available for perusal at <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/comparaFamiliesAnalysis-py\">tinyurl.com/comparaFamiliesAnalysis-py</a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe output from Step B is the _C<sub>v</sub>_, _Z<sub>max</sub>_ and _E<sub>max</sub>_ values for each of the families."
