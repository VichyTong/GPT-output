    "\nPreparation of culture dishes\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1: Prepare 0.6% Bacto agar in 121 mM NaCl . Cool to 48C in a waterbath and mix with 50ml thin albumin collected with a syringe from fertilised eggs. Poor 3ml of the mix into in culture plates and allow to gel at room temperature \\(plates can be kept several days at 4C)\r\n\n\n2: Prepare circular rings of Whatman filter paper by cutting out the central disk \\(25mm) and sterilise the rings..\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIsolation of embryos \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis part of the procedure is analogous to that used in the widely used EC culture protocol",

We normally cut the O rings which facilitates their mounting in the groove of the culture plate. \r\n\n\n5: Remove the filter ring outside the embryo by tearing the vitelline membrane with fine forces  \r\n\n\n6: Place the culture plate in a sterile 3cm petridish and fill with 3ml of thin albumin and remove any yolk extruding from undernesth the vitelline membrane into the four escape ports. \r\n\n\n7: For observation in a lightsheet microscope we mount the culture plate at the bottom of an observation chamber \\(microscope coverslip box, 7x3x1.8 centimeter, Fig 2E). To immobilise the culture plate we make an agar mould that will fit the culture plate. The mould is prepared in advance by placing an unused culture plate in the centre of the observation chamber and filling it with 2ml 1% agar in saline. After the agar is solidified the empty culture plate is taken out and replaced with the culture plate that has the embryo mounted \\(Fig 2F)\r\n\n\n8: Fill box with 10ml thin egg white containing optionally Pen/Strep to prevent bacterial contamination. \r\n\n\n9: Mount preparation under the Lightsheet microscope and cover the albumin with 2 ml light silicon oil to prevent evaporation."
