Please note that we are trying to add further secondary outcomes and this section of the protocol is still evolving.\n\n \n\nStatistical Methods:\n\nStatistical analysis will be performed by R version 3.6.1 software. We will use Kaplan–Meier to analyze the time to clinical improvement (compared with a log-rank test). Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using the Cox proportional-hazards model in crude and adjusted analysis."
