Temperature is very important for successful oxytocin release induced by high potassium. Therefore, the sample must be kept at 37C for as long as possible during the preparation and experiment. For example, the bath temperature was set at 37C beforehand. The solution, pipette tip, Eppendorf tubes and plates were pre-warmed in the water bath or dry incubator at 37C.
