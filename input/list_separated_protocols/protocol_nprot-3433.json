After the 5 min incubation, combine the diluted plasmids with the diluted Polyjet. Mix gently by inverting 6-8 times.\r\n\n\ne. Incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature to allow the plasmids-Polyjet complexes to form. Mix by shaking.\r\n\n\n2a.

Resuspend the cells \\(0.5 ml for 10 cm dish; 1.5 ml for 15 cm dish) in IMDM or DMEM containing serum. Cell counting is unnecessary if you can judge the cells you need by calculating the culture surface area and cell density. Do not include antibiotics in the medium.\r\n\n\n2b. Mix cells with plasmids-polyjet complexes, lay down the tube, fix it, and shake for 30 minutes on the shaker."

The percentage of syncytia can be used as marker of transfection efficiency. This morphological change is normal and does not affect production of the lentivirus. One day after successful transfection, 293T cells should be a little rounded up without significant proliferation."
