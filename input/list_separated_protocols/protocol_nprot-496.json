For example, by replacing the metal concentrations used here with assays for enzymatic activities, fluorescence or UV/visible absorbance, and using principal component analysis to compare the rise and fall in abundance of each protein with the rise and fall of activity/fluorescence/absorbance. Further, applying PCA to the protein abundances alone can reveal the presence of protein-protein interactions within the complex protein mixture. Alternative methods to one dimensional SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for estimation of protein abundance, such as quantitative mass fingerprinting, can also be applied in an analogous manner."
