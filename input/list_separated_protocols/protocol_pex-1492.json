The massage began on the medial side and ended on the lateral side for each muscle. We attempted to apply the same amount of force to the skin.(26)</p><p>11. In addition, the participants will be assigned a Home Exercise Routine, which they must perform twice daily.</p><p>12. <strong>GROUP B</strong>: Calf Stretching+ Home exercise program + Contrast Bath.</p><p><strong>13. Gastrosoleus stretching: </strong>Patient in Supine with legs straight out in front, and spread the leg with a small rolled up towel under the knee.</p><p>14. This is to keep the knee safe when doing the stretch.</p><p>15. Pressured the patient's ankle up towards the therapist with the aid of a hand or body weight.</p><p>16. Patient will feel a stretch in calf muscle.</p><p>17. It was carried out for 10 sec hold and 10 repetitions.</p><p>18. The stretch was held at a level of intensity where the patient complained of minor pain.</p><p>19. The treatment lasted a week.</p><p>20. Before and after a week of intervention, a pre and post examination was conducted.</p><p><strong>21. The Home Exercise Program for both the groups will consist of:</strong></p><p><strong>22. Exercises for intrinsic muscles strengthening:</strong></p><p>23. Towel curl up: Participants sat with their feet down on the end of a towel placed on a smooth surface and a little weight on the other end of the towel.</p><p>24. Active ankle exercises: In supine lying for (10 times) </p><p>25. Plantar fascia stretching with tennis ball.
