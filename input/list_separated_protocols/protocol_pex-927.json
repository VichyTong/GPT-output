    "\n<p>1.1 Instrument Setup</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer to the ArcturusXT™ Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) System user guide for in depth supplemental information.&nbsp;</p><p><u>STEP 1: </u>Turn on the computer.</p><p><u>STEP 2</u>: Turn on the Eclipse™ Ti-E microscope base using the switch located on the back of the microscope</p><p><u>STEP 3</u>: Turn on the ArcturusXT™ Instrument. Facing the microscope, the power button is located on the left side of the instrument. </p><p><u>STEP 4</u>: Start the software by clicking the ArcturusXT™ icon on the Windows™ desktop, or click Start, point to Programs, and click the ArcturusXT™ option. The software opens to fill the screen.</p><p>1.2&nbsp;Slide Setup</p><p><u>STEP 1</u>: In the setup tool panel click Present Stage</p><p><u>STEP 2</u>: Load your slides and CapSure™ Caps onto the microscope stage.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> For every cap in the cassette, make sure the corresponding cap offload position (on the right side of the work surface) is empty.</p><p><u>STEP 3</u>: On the Load Caps panel click on the box next to HS or Macro depending on which cap you will be using. Then click the empty circles to represent how many caps were loaded. </p><p>IMPORTANT: The system does not have a sensor to detect caps on the loading station or at the QC station. If you do not indicate to the system that there is a cap is at the QC station and try to offload another cap to the same position, you can cause damage to the microscope. </p><p><u>STEP 4:</u> Use the Slide panel to select which slot your working slide was placed (A, B or C). </p><p><u>STEP 5:</u> To choose the slide type being used, you must click the box to the right of the letter slot chosen in step",

This glass slide serves as support for the tissue during this procedure. Place a clean glass slide on the “flat” side of the membrane slide to act as a solid support.
