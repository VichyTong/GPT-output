The basal vessel unfurled into a plexus and during the E9 to E11 interval grew in a ventral to dorsal and lateral to medial direction, straddling the lateral ventricles \\(Fig. 2e-i). The periventricular plexus was restricted to a ~20 µm-thick plane parallel to the pial surface and sandwiched between the ventricular and marginal zones in the E11 dorsal telencephalon \\(Fig. 2b-d).

The whole mounts are especially valuable because they permit a global view of the entire vascular network while preserving its anatomical relationships. Explants of the dorsal and ventral telencephalon maintained in culture are ideal for illustrating endothelial cell migration across telencephalic compartments. Although manipulation of the neural tube or embryonic telencephalon for preparation of the explants is a delicate procedure requiring micro-dissection expertise, the technique is a valuable tool for studying a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms in developmental biology. Combining the explant culture, cell transplantation and siRNA technologies permitted us to study the role of specific genes in the regulation of cross-compartmental migration of endothelial cells."
