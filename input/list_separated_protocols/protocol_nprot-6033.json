            "lists their advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, state of the art NGS techniques may be employed. A protocol that describes analysis of Ig repertoires has recently been published<sup>17</sup>. This method uses \"unique molecular identifier\" \\(UMI) sequences which are introduced during generation of cDNA and therefore allow for precise quantification of individual mRNA molecules. This protocol is recommended because it reveals the entire Ig-H- and Ig-L-chain repertoires quantitatively, whereas Sanger-sequencing and single cell sequencing may reveal only a limited spectrum of the repertoires.\r\n\n\nSecondly, traditional transcriptome analysis has been outlined earlier<sup>10</sup>. A detailed methodology of this Sanger sequencing based method is available^19. These steps describe isolation of RNA, RT-PCR, cloning and sequence analysis of Ig-H and Ig-L chains.\r\n\n\nThirdly, techniques for analyzing Ig chains from single B cells were recently advanced from traditional sequencing methods<sup>2,3</sup> to NGS techniques<sup>18</sup>. Although both Sanger-sequencing and NGS based methods directly will yield paired Ig-H and Ig-L chains, it will be uncertain how they will relate to distinct OCBs or other expanded Ig species. Moreover, it will not be clear whether or not a certain Ig-H and Ig-L pair will yield an OCB at all. This is an important issue, since only limited number of OCBs \\(usually less than",
