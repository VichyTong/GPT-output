At the time of writing, gold grids have provided superior results, but any grid substrate that minimizes beam-induced movement can be employed in the future. For the most part, vitrification is identical between holey carbon and holey gold grids, although some differences might be observed, most notably that blotting times tend to be shorter for gold grids. We have also observed slight differences in particle concentration and extent of preferred particle orientation on grids, both of which are specimen dependent."
