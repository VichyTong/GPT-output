Test vessels are left at room temperature for 1 hour to allow equilibrium of the medium and toxicant.\r\n\n\n2.2 Selection of test concentrations\r\n\n\nSet the concentration of the test substances using half dilution of the medium and the toxicity test solution. In cases of uncertainty about sample toxicity, it is beneficial to run a range-finding test for choosing concentrations of definitive test. A wide range of concentrations \\(e.g., ≥ an order of magnitude) should assist in selection of the concentrations for the definitive test.\r\n\n\nIn case the test solution is an effluent or liquid material, set the concentration to 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, and 100%. The concentration should be selected so that different levels \\(4-5 sections) of growth can occur in the range of less than 10% to over 90%. It is best to choose the range of concentrations through preliminary experiments, which includes broad range of concentrations.\r\n\n\n2.3 Control\r\n\n\nAll experiments require a negative control with the identical culture medium, test conditions and procedures, but exclude the test substance."
