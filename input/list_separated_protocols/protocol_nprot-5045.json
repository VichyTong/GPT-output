For example for 25 ng of DNA transpose using 1.25 μL of Tn5, while for 125 ng of DNA transpose with 4 μL of Tn5. Using the correct amount of Tn5 is critical to the HiChIP protocol to achieve an ideal size distribution. An overtransposed sample will have shorter fragments and will exhibit lower alignment rates \\(when the junction is close to a fragment end). An undertransposed sample will have fragments that are too large to cluster properly on an Illumina sequencer. A maximum amount of Tn5 is used in order to save on Tn5 costs, and considering that a library with this much material will be amplified in 5 cycles and have enough complexity to be sequenced deeply regardless of how fully transposed the library is to achieve an ideal size distribution."
