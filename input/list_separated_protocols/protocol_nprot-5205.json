        "body": "*Cautions before working with DMS:\r\n\n\nDMS is highly toxic and should only be used in a well-ventilated fume hood. We recommend using multiple layers of nitrile gloves such that the exterior layer can be removed and replaced after handling DMS directly. DMS should have a faint yellow color, that will become darker due to oxidation over time. Open a fresh bottle of DMS every six months to ensure freshness and optimal reactivity. DMS will be quenched during the following procedure by BME and resulting liquid waste should be disposed of per your local hazardous waste regulations. With the exception of the centrifugation steps and final steps of total RNA extraction, all steps should be done in a fume hood.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\na. _S. cerevisiae_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n● Dilute saturated overnight yeast cultures to OD600 of ~0.09, and grow at 30°C to a final log phase OD600 of 0.5-0.7 at the time of DMS treatment.\r\n\n\n● Pre-chill a 30 ml stop solution on ice for > 1 hour before DMS treatment. Stop solution contains 15 ml 100% isoamyl alcohol, 9 ml BME, and 6 ml ddH2O. Also prepare and pre-chill a 10 ml wash solution containing 3 ml BME and 7 ml ddH2O. \\(Solutions will phase separate, invert to mix directly prior to use.)\r\n\n\n● Move 15 ml of log-phase yeast culture into a 50 ml conical and place in a rack submerged in a 30°C water bath, such that the entire 15 ml culture is just submerged.\r\n\n\n● Pipet 750 µl of DMS \\(5% v/v) into the yeast culture, stirring immediately with a serological pipet. Treat the yeast for 4 min, with consistent stirring or swirling of the culture. Culture should remain submerged in the water bath during this time.\r\n\n\n● Pour ice cold 30 ml stop solution into yeast culture with DMS, cap, invert to mix, and place on ice. The DMS will be fully hydrolyzed by the BME at this point.\r\n\n\n● Centrifuge 50 ml conical for 4 min at 3,500 x g at 4°C. Optional: parafilm the lids to minimize the smell of DMS if centrifuge is located outside of a fume hood.\r\n\n\n● Decant supernatant into DMS/BME waste, will have a small pellet of yeast at the bottom. Pour in ice-cold wash solution, and shake/pipet to resuspend yeast pellet.\r\n\n\n● Parafilm lid \\(optional) and spin again for 4 min at 3,500 x g at 4°C.\r\n\n\n● Decant supernatant into waste. Residual wash solution remaining in tube is fine, and traces of remaining BME in tube will quench any remaining DMS released upon cell lysis.\r\n\n\n● Add 0.6 ml total RNA lysis buffer \\(6 mM EDTA, 45 mM NaOac pH 5.5) to tube and resuspend yeast pellet by pipet. Move sample to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube that contains 40 µl 20% SDS. \r\n\n\n● Prewarm 0.65 ml of acid phenol in thermomixer at 65°C. \r\n\n\n● Move tube with yeast/SDS mixture to 65°C thermomixer and shake at 1,400 rpm for 30 sec to ensure mixing of SDS.\r\n\n\n● Add yeast sample to tube with hot acid phenol. Incubate in thermomixer at 65°C, shaking for 2 min at 1,400 rpm. Note, that DMS-treated RNA can be brittle and high temperature or vortexing steps should be minimized to prevent fragmentation.\r\n\n\n● Immediately move samples into a dry ice / EtOH bath \\(<sub>1:1 composition) until frozen, </sub>3 min.\r\n\n\n● Spin tubes 3 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n● Add 0.65 ml acid phenol \\(room temperature) to aqueous phase. Incubate at room temperature in thermomixer for 2-3 min, shaking at 1400 rpm.\r\n\n\n● Spin tubes 3 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n● Add 0.65 ml RNase-free chloroform and vortex at room temperature in thermomixer for 30 sec. Spin tubes 2 min at 20,000 x g at room temp and immediately remove top aqueous phase into new 1.5 ml tube, avoiding material at the phase interface.\r\n\n\n● Add >1 volume isopropanol \\(ex. 700 µl) to final aqueous phase. Invert to mix well and chill >30min at -30°C.\r\n\n\n● Spin >45 min at 20,000 x g at 4°C to pellet nucleic acids.\r\n\n\n● Remove supernatant and wash pellet in 0.75 ml 70-80% EtOH.\r\n\n\n● Pulse spin tube to collect residual EtOH at the bottom, and remove all liquid with small pipet tip.\r\n\n\n● Air-dry 5 min and resuspend in 50 µl 10 mM Tris pH 7.0. May need to add additional volume if the pellet is large.\r\n\n\n● Nanodrop a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution of RNA sample. Procedure should yield >50-100 µg RNA.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nb. Adherent human cells\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n● Begin with a 15 cm2 plate of fully adherent HEK 293T cells in 15 ml media \\(other adherent cell lines will work with the procedure too). \r\n\n\n● Working a fume hood, remove 10 ml media from the plate into a 50 ml conical and add 200-300 µl DMS. Shake vigorously to ensure mixing.\r\n\n\n● Slowly pipette the DMS/media mixture back on the plate by tilting the plate and pipetting into a corner. Note that this step has to be done very carefully to avoid lifting cells from the plate. \r\n\n\n● Parafilm the plate, and move it to a 37°C incubator / hybridization oven for 5 min, keeping the plate in a fume hood if possible and swirling occasionally. Some cells may become detached during treatment.\r\n\n\n● Slowly pipet out the DMS/media into waste.\r\n\n\n● Add 10 ml of 30% v/v BME \\(diluted in 1 x PBS) and collect the cells into a 15 ml conical using a scraper to scrape the cells from the plate.  \r\n\n\n● Centrifuge cells at 1000 x g at 4°C for 3 min; decant the BME solution. \r\n\n\n● Wash the cells by adding 10 ml of 1 x PBS and repeating the centrifugation step. Decant the PBS. \r\n\n\n● Add 1 ml Trizol to plate, lysing cells, and extracting total RNA according to the Trizol protocol \\(Optional: if using higher amounts of DMS you may add 10 µl 100% BME to the Trizol).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nc. _D. melanogaster_ ovaries\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n● Begin with 100 D. melanogaster ovaries, removed via microdissection and collected in 250 µl 1 x PBS in an Eppendorf tube. \r\n\n\n● Add 100-250 µl DMS to ovaries \\(depending on desired level of modification), shaking at 500 rpm in a thermomixer for 5 min at 26°C. \r\n\n\n● Stop the reaction with the addition of 1 ml of 30% v/v BME solution.\r\n\n\n● Transfer suspension into a sieve, removing DMS/BME liquid. \r\n\n\n● With ovaries still in the sieve, wash 3 x \\(in a 6 well cell culture plate) with 1 ml of 30% v/v BME, followed by 2 washes with dH2O.\r\n\n\n● After final wash, collect ovaries from sieve into an Eppendorf tube using a pipette.\r\n\n\n● Remove residual dH2O, and resuspend in 1 ml Trizol\r\n\n\n● Grind ovaries in Trizol.\r\n\n\n● Extract total RNA according to Trizol protocol."

Additional options/variations of the PCR protocol can be found under the troubleshooting section of this protocol. PCR primers should be designed with Tm > 62°C.

Longer amplicons \\(~2 kb) can be amplified successfully if highly abundant, ex. rRNA. To assess the success of a PCR amplification, we recommended running two PCR reactions in parallel—one that is limited in cycle number according to the following instructions and another with a high number of PCR cycles that can be easily visualized on an agarose or TBE polyacrylamide gel.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n● Start with 1 µl from the purified cDNA above \\(~ 1/12 of the sample).\r\n\n\n● Set up 50 µl PCR reaction using the Advantage HF 2 PCR kit and its included HF buffer, dNTPs, and 1 µl 50 x HF polymerase.

The UMI, combined with unique mismatch profiles from DMS modification itself, can be used to collapse to unique reads and remove any biases generated during rounds of PCR.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n● Follow the protocol as above through reverse transcription, with one adjustment. The gene-specific RT primer should be designed with 10 random nucleotides on the 5’ end, preceded by a primer-binding overhang that will be used in the first round of PCR \\(see the oMZ282 primer sequence).
