"\n1.Flush mouse tibiae and femurs with ice-cold PBS through a 70 &#x3BC;m-wide cut-off cell strainer.\r\n\n\n2.Centrifuge 5&#x2019; at 1400 rpm. Resuspend pelleted cells in conditioned medium \\(supplemented with 30% of growth supernatant of M-CSF-transduced L929 cells).\r\n\n\n3.Seed 7 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 100 x 20 mm non-treated cell culture plates in 10 ml of conditioned medium.\r\n\n\n4.Incubate at 37 &#xB0;C &#x2013; 5% CO2.\r\n\n\n5.Upon reaching confluence \\(approximately 7 days) split adhered cells and seed 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 100 x 20 mm in non-treated cell culture plates in 10 ml of conditioned medium.\r\n\n\n6.BMMFs are ready for experimental use when the percentage of CD11b+ cells is higher than 90% as measured by FACS analysis."
