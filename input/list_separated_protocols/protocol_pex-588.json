"\n<p><u>Purification of human plasma proteins for SDS Poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis:&nbsp;</u></p><p>1. Initially 100 µl of plasma was taken in 1.5 ml eppendorf&nbsp;tubes in&nbsp;5 replicates.</p><p>Then 1000 µl each of 10 to 50% TCA-Acetone was added to each of 100 µl plasma samples in eppendorf tubes.</p><p>2. The tube was kept at -20<sup>0</sup>C for overnight.</p><p>3. Then the tube was centrifuged at 15000g for 10 minutes.</p><p>4. The supernatant was discarded and 90% acetone was added.</p><p>5. Then the tube was kept in -20<sup>0</sup>C for 10 minutes.</p><p>6. The tube was centrifuged at 15000g for 10 minutes.</p><p>7. The supernatant was discarded and kept it for drying.</p><p>8. Finally 50 to 500µl rehydration buffer was added in to the dried pellet.</p><p>9. After human plasma protein purification, the protein was resolved in a 10% running gel and 5% stalking gel and stained with 0.2% coomassiae brilliant blue R250 solution. Then the gel was clearly visualized with a proper de-staining solution. The gel image was taken by geldoc (Biorad, USA).&nbsp;</p>"
