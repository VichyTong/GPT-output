    "\nThe Multiple Integration Element \\(MIE) was derived from a polylinker<sup>4</sup> and allows for several approaches for multigene assembly. Single or multiple genes can be inserted into the MIE of any of the ACEMBL vectors by a variety of methods. For this, the vector needs to be linearized, which can be carried out efficiently by PCR reaction with appropriate primers, since the vectors are all small \\(2-2.6 kb). Alternatively, if more conventional approaches are preferred i.e. in a regular wet lab setting without robotics, the vectors can also be linearized by restriction digestion, and a gene of interest can be pasted in by ligation. The following protocols describe these approaches in detail.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n",

As all ACEMBL plasmids contain a single LoxP site, they can be fused in a _Cre_-dependent reaction.
