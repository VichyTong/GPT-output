For constructing fluorescence reporter, clone the D/A unit into the multiple cloning site of DsRedExpress-GFP vector \\(Siskoglu and Nasim, unpublished data). Generate a negative control construct by deleting polyadenylation site, the splicing unit and the 5’ UTR, which will lead to the generation of upstream reporter only. This will also help to identify any potential internal initiation site located upstream of the downstream reporter. For bait and prey construct, clone your gene of interest into the multiple cloning site of the vector pTN111 and pTN112. \r\n  \r\n\n\nAs mentioned before, the underlying principle can be used to provide a dual-reporter equivalent of single reporter assays such as MAPPIT. The construct rPAP1-luci can easily be upgraded by inserting the upstream expression unit \\(Reporter A, Figure",
