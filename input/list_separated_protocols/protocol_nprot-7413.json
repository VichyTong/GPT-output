A piezo translation stage mounted to the microscope is used for fine-positioning of the trap right before a trapping experiment starts. The beam diameter of a CW laser at a wavelength of 808 nm used for the heating of the chrome ring is increased by a beam expander. Afterwards, the widened laser beam is sent through an acousto-optic deflector \\(AOD) and a lens system which allows for the steering of the laser focus in the sample plane on the circumference of the chrome ring. Fluorescence excitation of the labeled fibrils is done with a 445 nm CW laser which is focused to the back-focal plane of the objective to attain a homogeneous illumination of the sample in the trapping region. Both laser beams are merged by a pellicle beam splitter \\(BS). A dichroic mirror \\(D) is selected according to the excitation and the heating laser wavelengths as well as the emission wavelength of the labeled sample. Reflections of the heating laser in the detection pathway are blocked with a short-pass filter. Fluorescent light of the sample is imaged to an EMCCD after passing a bandpass filter \\(F) as well as a tube lens. The AD/DA converter drives the acousto-optic deflector and the piezo stage. The fluorescence is imaged in real time and the control of the AD/DA converter \\(ADwin) is done with a custom LabVIEW program.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<figure>\r\n\n\n<center>\r\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7633/original/Experimental_Setup.png?1552666322\" title=\"Figure 2\" height=\"250px\">\r\n\n\n<figcaption> <font size=\"1\">"

Commonly, the ambient illumination in these rooms is realized with yellow fluorescent light tubes containing filters blocking all light components which are below 500 nm.
