"\n<p><strong>* Perform every step in the biosafety cabinet</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Generation of normal mouse bladder assembloids</strong></p><p>* This protocol is standardized to a preparation of culture in 2 wells of 12-well plate (= 10 assembloids).</p><p>*&nbsp;A day before,&nbsp;thaw 60 µl of Matrigel<strong>&nbsp;</strong>overnight at 4 °C.</p><p>* Prepare long-term (&gt; 6 months) bladder organoids, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), HULEC, bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMC) cultures in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>1. Prepare two sheets of Parafilm at the size of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm, put them in a 100 mm petri dish.</p><p>* Spray your gloves and the Parafilm with 70 % (vol/vol) ethanol.</p><p>2. Prepare long-term bladder organoids.</p><p>a. Release the bladder organoids from Matrigel drop by physically pipetting the organoid medium and collect them in a new 15 ml tube.</p><p>b. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 °C, for 5 min.</p><p>c. Remove the supernatant, wash the organoid pellets with 1 ml of Advanced DMEM/F12 medium.</p><p>d. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 °C, for 5 min.</p><p>e. Remove the supernatant, add 1-2 ml of DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin.</p><p>f. Transfer the organoids with medium to the 35 mm petri dish, plate the dish on ice.</p><p>3. Prepare MEF and HULEC mixture.</p><p>a. Prepare 1.5 x 10<sup>6 </sup>MEF and 2 x 10<sup>5 </sup>HULEC, put together in one microcentrifuge tube.</p><p>b. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 °C, for 3 min.</p><p>c. Remove the supernatant, add 40 μl Matrigel to cell pellets (perform on ice), plate on ice</p><p>4. Set 20p pipette at 4 μl, take one organoid only.</p><p>* Take &lt; 1 μl of organoid (+ medium that follows when picking the organoid) while holding it.</p><p>5. Take up to 4 μl of MEF and HULEC mixture.</p><p>* Mix the MEF and HULEC mixture well before taking the mixture.</p><p>6. Make the Matrigel droplet (containing an organoid, MEF, and HULEC) on a sheet of Parafilm.</p><p>7. Place the organoid in the center of the droplet by gently pipetting the Matrigel droplet.</p><p>8. Repeat the procedure 6-7 to generate 10 droplets.</p><p>* Make 5 droplets on each sheet. This generates 10 droplets on 2 sheets.</p><p>9. Incubate at 37 °C for 5-10 min to solidify the gel.</p><p>10. Remove the droplets from the Parafilm using a fine forceps, put them in a 12-well version of spinning bioreactor containing 2 ml of pre-warmed assembloid medium.</p><p>* Put 5-7 droplets in each well of 12-well plate.</p><p>11. Culture the droplets (= organoid with stroma) in a spinning bioreactor in 37 °C incubator with 5.0 % CO<sub>2 </sub>for two days.</p><p>* If you don't have a 12-well version of spinning bioreactor, orbital shaker (95 rpm) can be alternatively used.</p><p>12. Prepare two sheets of Parafilm at the size of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm, put them in a 100 mm petri dish.</p><p>* Spray your gloves and the Parafilm with 70 % (vol/vol) ethanol.</p><p>13. Prepare BSMC and HULEC mixture.</p><p>a. Prepare 6 x 10<sup>5 </sup>BSMC and 6 x 10<sup>5 </sup>HULEC, put together in one microcentrifuge tube.</p><p>b. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm, 4 °C, for 3 min.</p><p>c. Remove the supernatant, add 20 μl Matrigel to cell pellets (perform on ice), plate on ice</p><p>14. Take out the cultures of bladder organoid with stroma from the incubator, take each of them (+ medium that follows when picking the organoid with stroma) using 20p pipette, and put on a sheet of Parafilm.</p><p>15. After removing the residual medium from the Parafilm, take 2 μl of BSMC and HULEC mixture using 20p pipette, put it on each of organoid with stroma to make the layered Matrigel droplet.</p><p>* Place the organoid with stroma in the center of the droplet by genetly pipetting the Matrigel droplet.</p><p>16. Repeat the procedure 14-15 to generate 10 droplets.</p><p>* Make 5 droplets on each sheet. This generates 10 droplets on 2 sheets.</p><p>17. Incubate at 37 °C for 5-10 min to solidify the gel.</p><p>18.
