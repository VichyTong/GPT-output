Then determine the IDV for all the selected nuclei and calculate the mean nucleus value.\r\n\n\n• Divide the blue channel IDV by the mean nucleus value. The resulting value corresponds to the average number of cells present in each respective ROI.\r\n\n\n• Next, to avoid quantifying the membrane signal of β-catenin, the signal that colocalize between β- and alpha-catenin is substracted. For that, open the Image calculator from the Process menu and create a new image using the operator Substract \\(Image1: β-catenin, Image 2: alpha-catenin).\r\n\n\n• Create a merged image combining the substracted image with the blue channel image using the operator AND. The merged picture shows nuclear localized β-catenin.\r\n\n\n• Measure the IDV of the respective ROI in this newly created merged image and divide it by the average number of cells calculated before. This represents the β-catenin content per nucleus.\r\n\n\n• Represent the obtained values in scattered plots representing the level of expression for each protein per cell nucleus analyzed, noted as relative units \\(r. u.) indicating mean and 95% confidence interval.\r\n\n\n• Do suitable statistics, such as the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test that is used to compare three or more groups of unpaired values that did not follow any particular distribution. Thereby, Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test serves to identify the significance \\(P value)of differences in the sum of ranks between each pair of groups of values."
