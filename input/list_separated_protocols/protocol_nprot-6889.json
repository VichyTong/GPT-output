            "Unlike PWAS-p, these can result in the larger magnitudes which can be added advantage.

In our case, Figure 6\\(a) shows a peak at 28.25 KHz, which is neither increasing nor decreasing as similar to Figure 4\\(a) of PWAS-p patch.

Figure 6 \\(d) shows a very sensitive range where the peaks shifted in higher magnitudes, than Figure 6\\(c), which too show the upward or downward deviations of loaded specimen. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(F) Observe any interesting features such as change in boundary conditions. In our case, two boundary conditions i.e at baseline \\(0 gm) and at loading process were observed. These signatures \\(Figure 6: a-d) show lots of information which is similar or better than the information provided by PWAS-p \\(Figure 4: a-d), which is so far considered to be best in SHM applications for EMA. It should be noted that the interaction between PWAS-p and host structure is by an epoxy layer \\(Madhav and Soh 2007), whereas in this PWAS-t, epoxy adhesive is absent and the interaction between patch and host structure is direct. However, there will not be any structural peaks but the magnetic force provides a unique bonding force. At least in our experiment, the sensitivity of this PWAS-t patch seems to be better. \\(Note: Selection of magnet plays important role.) \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2.4 Incremental crack effect on signatures obtained from PWAS-p and PWAS-t \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n-- Procedure for the crack monitoring \\(experiment 2 is shown in Figure 2\\(d), it was a specimen with fixed-fixed boundary condition). Readers can replicate our results as follows.\r\n\n\n\\(A) Induce cracks of 1 cm at some locations starting from PWAS-t. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(B) Record signatures from both patches after inducing cracks \\(at 0 cm, 3 cm, 6 cm, 9 cm, 12 cm, 15 cm, 18 cm and 21 cm) at regular intervals, away from the PWAS-t patch as shown in Figure. Experiment2 resulted in signatures which presents larger magnitude shifts unlike the loading increment case. See Figures 7 and 8, signatures obtained from both PWAS-p and PWAS-t at all crack increments, \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(c) Readers can use sharp blade to induce cracks on specimen but in our experiment,  we used hacksaw blade. This created much disturbance to the structure and it got reflected as 'high magnitude changes in peaks and valleys'.  It should be noted that the crack magnitude increased in steps from the location of PWAS-t towards PWAS-p as shown in Figure 2\\(d). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(D) You can obtain 2 sets of signatures, when cracks are induced away from PWAS-t and approaching PWAS-p. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(E) The signatures shift so large that the 'signature analysis' as carried-out in the previous load increment case cannot be appropriate because it does not provide meaningful shifting patterns of peaks. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(F) Apply root mean square deviation \\(RMSD) index to study the deviations, especially to quantify changes in signatures \\(Park et al 2006, Annamdas and Yang 2012).  The RMSD is a comparable index of the initial signature with later stage signatures \\(k = 1, 2,3 …). In the present study the RMSD index was adopted to evaluate the signatures obtained from the ‘PWAS-specimen’ system. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(G) Tabulate your results. Table",

RMSD indices obtained from PWAS-p shows increasing trends as the crack magnitudes increased towards its direction whereas the RMSD indices obtained from PWAS-t shows decreasing trends as the cracks increased in the opposite direction. The larger magnitudes of RMSD indices of PWAS-t compared to RMSD-p is attributed to direct interaction between PWAS-t and the host structure unlike PWAS-p \\(which is via bonding layer). This also depends on magnetic force magnitude. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(I) The larger values also can be attributed to the movement of main and support magnets during the cracking process by hacksaw blade. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(J) In real applications the cracks are seldom generated using a hacksaw blade but they occur due to natural process and hence the movement of magnets will not occur. \r\n\n\n From experiments 1 and 2 \\(load and crack increment studies) it is understood that PWAS-t is effective in dealing with SHM applications on par or better than PWAS-p.
