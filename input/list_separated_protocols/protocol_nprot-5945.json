"\n_General culture conditions_\r\n\n\nTest all cultures for the presence of mycoplasma upon receipt. Antibiotics are not included in the media so that contamination can be spotted immediately if it arises. Proper sterile technique is essential. Wear appropriate PPE and only open plates inside of a class 2 biosafety cabinet that is thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol before and after each use. Cells are grown in a humidified 37°C tissue culture incubator in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 20% O<sub>2</sub>. Culture medium is changed daily. It is advisable to select low passage cell lines that have been whole genome or whole exome sequenced to reduce the risk of selecting cells with unwanted mutations that could affect downstream experiments<sup>16</sup>. We also suggest routinely monitoring the genomic integrity of cell lines by targeted sequencing or microarray. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Coating plates for thawing hESCs from diverse sources_\r\n\n\nIf the culture conditions \\(feeder or feeder-free) of hESCs to be thawed are known, prepare plates to match these conditions, as described below. If cell lines from diverse sources are to be thawed concurrently, coat one well of a 6-well plate with ice-cold Matrigel or Geltrex according to manufacturer instructions. Rinse off excess briefly with PBS before plating cells in 2 ml warm KSR:mTeSR1 with 10 μM RI. Coat a second well of a 6-well plate with 0.1% gelatin for 30 minutes at 37°C, rinse briefly with PBS, and plate MEFs in MEF medium at a density of approximately 50,000 cells per square centimeter, or to evenly coat the well to 100% confluence. Allow MEFs to attach for at least 24 hours before plating hESCs. Immediately before plating, rinse wells briefly with PBS and add 2 ml warm KSR medium with 10 μM RI. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Thawing hESC lines from diverse sources_\r\n\n\nUpon receipt, store cryovials of hESC lines in liquid nitrogen \\(gas phase) until use. To minimize stress to hESCs previously cultured and frozen under diverse conditions, cells are adapted to a rich medium that supports pluripotency, consisting of a 1:1 mix of KSR and mTeSR1 \\(KSR:mTeSR1). To thaw vials, prepare and label plates ahead of time as described above and pre-warm 21 ml KSR:mTeSR1 + 10 μM RI to 37°C. Transfer the cryovial from storage into the tissue culture room on dry ice, and transfer it directly into a floating rack in a a 37°C water bath for approximately 1 minute or until the cell suspension has started to thaw but is still partially frozen. Quickly transfer the cells to a 15 ml conical tube containing 10 ml pre-warmed KSR:mTeSR1 + 10 μM RI. Centrifuge the cells at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes, re-suspend the pellet again in 10 ml pre-warmed KSR:mTeSR1 + 10 μM RI and centrifuge, and then resuspend the resulting pellet in 1 ml warm KSR:mTeSR1 + 10 mM RI and plate 0.5 ml per well. Change medium after 24 hours to remove RI and feed cells daily thereafter. Cells on MEFs are fed with KSR medium, whereas cells on Matrigel are fed with KSR:mTeSR1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_hESC passaging and expansion_ \r\n\n\nUnder phase contrast microscopy, hESCs should have prominent nucleoli and a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. Cells with different morphology, especially if elongated or flattened, likely indicate differentiation to non-pluripotent cell types. Some hESC lines will rapidly and uniformly expand under feeder-free conditions with no morphologically distinguishable signs of differentiation. These lines can be passaged once plates reach approximately 90% confluence with EDTA. EDTA is preferable for routine passaging since it is non-enzymatic and hPSCs are dispersed into small clumps of cells rather than single cells<sup>8,17</sup>. This allows colonies to be efficiently dispersed with high rates of survival while eliminating enzymatic treatment and reducing mechanical handling of cells. \r\n\n\nBriefly rinse plates with PBS and incubate with warm EDTA for approximately 5 minutes at 37°C, or until cells take on a rounded, bright morphology under phase contrast microscopy. Cells should not spontaneously detach from the plate but can be easily dislodged when approximately 100 microliters of EDTA is pipetted onto the plate with a P1000. If they have not reached this point, continue incubation and monitor every minute. Once cells easily wash off the plate, gently aspirate the EDTA while leaving the cells attached, and wash the hESCs off of the plate with 1 ml warm KSR:mTeSR1 + 10 μM RI with RI using a P1000.  For expansion, re-plate the entire cell suspension onto a Matrigel-coated 10 cm plate containing 10 ml KSR:mTeSR1 + 10 μM RI. \r\n\n\nOther hESC lines may grow as well-defined colonies upon thawing since they were frozen as colonies of cell chunks, or because of small cell numbers or poor survival of frozen cells. If all colonies contain cells with hESC morphology, disperse them with EDTA as described above once they reach a diameter of approximately 400 microns. Re-plate them onto a matrigel-coated well of a 6 well plate as described above in 2 ml of medium. At this higher density, they will grow as more of a monolayer than as distinct colonies<sup>9,18</sup> and can soon be expanded onto a 10 cm plate. If cultures contain differentiated cells, they should be eliminated before expansion as described below. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Removing differentiated cells from hESC cultures_\r\n\n\nIt is important to eliminate differentiated cells from hESC cultures since these will interfere with downstream applications such as directed differentiation. If a defined regions of the plate contain differentiated cells, mark these under the microscope and rapidly aspirate them during cell feeding, taking care not to let cell cultures dry out during aspiration. Since hESCs typically adhere to the plate less tightly than differentiated cells, gentle EDTA passaging can enrich for pluripotent cells. If hESC cultures contain widespread differentiation, or if the cell line had best established on MEFs, identify and manually pick colonies with undifferentiated morphology using a P200 pipette under sterile conditions. Transfer colonies onto a fresh matrigel-coated plate 10 ml KSR:mTeSR1 + 10 μM RI. Take special care use good sterile practice during this procedure in which cultures are uncovered and particularly vulnerable to contamination. Once these picked colonies have established themselves, control any residual differentiation and expand pluripotent cells as described above. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Freezing hESCs in cryovials_\r\n\n\nTo bank hESCs for later use and and prepare samples for sequencing, pre-label 10 sterile cryovials per cell line with the cell line name, date, passage number, and any other relevant information. Avoid processing more than 2 cell lines at a time. Once cells have reached approximately 90% confluence, dissociate them with EDTA as described above, aspirate EDTA, and gently detach and re-suspend cells in 5 ml KSR:mTeSR1 + 10 μM RI. To mimimize osmotic shock to the cells while limiting the time they spend in the presence of concentrated DMSO, gently add an equal volume of ice-cold Freezing Medium, pipetting up and down as it is added over the course of 1 minute. Immediately distribute 1 ml of cell suspension to each cryovial, firmly cap, transfer to a freezing container and place at -80°C overnight before being transferred to liquid nitrogen \\(gas phase) for long-term storage."
