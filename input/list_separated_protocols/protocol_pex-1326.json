"\n<p>RING PREPARATION</p><p><strong>Thermanox&nbsp;rings</strong>&nbsp;were&nbsp;punched from coverslips and the ring hole was enlarged with scissors to a diameter of approximately 9 mm. The rings were washed with 70% EtOH and stored in a sterile petri dish.&nbsp;<strong>Agar rings</strong>&nbsp;were prepared by boiling 3% agarose in 1× PBS, followed by the pouring of a gel of about 2 mm high. After solidification of the gel, platelets were carefully cut out using the open end of 15 ml Falcon tubes and rings were prepared by cutting out the inlet with FACS tubes. The agar rings were stored in sterile PBS at 4°C.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>PVC tube rings</strong> were&nbsp;cutted out from PVC tubes by the use of sterile scissors, followed by washing&nbsp;with 70% ethanol and storage in a sterile petri dish. The basic material used for preparation of each ring type is shown in Fig. 1A, the preparation of rings in Fig. 1B and the final rings stored in Petri dishes in Fig. 1C.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EGG PREPARATION</p><p>This step was performed as described in our recent ProtocolExchange manuscript.<sup>11</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TUMOR XENOGRAFT TRANSPLANTATION</p><p>AsanPaCa cells were transplanted to fertilized chicken eggs at day 9 of development as described in our recent Nature Protocol Exchange manuscript.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;In detail, each ring type was placed on 10 chicken eggs each, followed by seeding of 1×10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;AsanPaCa&nbsp;cells&nbsp;in 25 µl&nbsp;Matrigel™&nbsp;into each ring, resulting in xenografts growing in Thermanox rings, agar rings, or PVC rings (Fig. 2A).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RESECTION OF XENOGRAFT TUMORS</p><p>The chick embryos were euthanized at day 18 of development followed by tumor xenograft resection, as described in our recent ProtocolExchange manuscript.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Images of the resected tumor xenografts and their individual volumes are shown (Fig. 2B) and there was no significant different size of the tumor xenografts detectable. Likewise, H&amp;E staining and microscopic evaluation of tumor xenograft sections revealed no obvious difference, as exemplified by representative images at&nbsp;400× magnification (Fig. 2C).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EVALUATION OF SIDE EFFECTS</p><p>To determine if there were differences in the tolerance of the different ring types on the CAM, we examined the weight of the embryos and any abnormalities. No abnormalities were detectable, because there was no obvious malformation (Fig. 3A), nor was a difference in the mean embryonal weight detectable (Fig. 3B).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
