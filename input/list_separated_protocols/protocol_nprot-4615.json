This step has been added to avoid biasing against regions located near the ends of input DNA pieces \\(because we perform a size selection after this fragmentation step, and sequences close to the ends would be represented by very small fragments after fragmentation, and thus would be under-represented in the final library). Specifically, for each ug of DNA, the DNA pool are ligated with 4,000 units of T4 DNA ligase in a 50 ul reaction for 3 hours at 37ºC. We start with ~20 ug total DNA that have 5’ phosphate groups. If directly using PCR products, perform a kinase reaction prior to ligation using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase."
