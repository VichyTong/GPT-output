Peptides composing the differential signatures can be further classified as ‘predicted’ or not \\(‘other’), where ‘predicted’ defines a peptide previously identified in literatures as a target of a given kinase. It is anticipated that many of the peptides would fall under the class ‘other’ since many peptides included in the differential signature of a kinase/kinase family would necessarily match peptides that in fact match other kinases/kinase families and thus allow to distinguish the kinase/kinase family of interest versus all others. \r\n\n\niv.

As an alternative method to find peptide sensors that are most significantly associated with high/low activity per kinase, users can test each kinase independently of all others, and use initially-separate-but-eventually-converging computational methods to compare levels of ATP consumption per individual peptide to the pool of \\(63) reference peptides. \r\n\n\ni. In the first approach, the average 228-activity data points from all experimental repeats is used in a Kalmagorov-Smirnov \\(KS) test comparing each 165-non-reference peptides \\(i.e. 151 biological peptides, and 14 positive control peptides) to the 63-reference peptides \\(p values with or without BH correction controlling for false-discovery rate).

The overlapping results of the computational processes and statistical cut-offs resulting from these two separate computational methods identify the most significantly and stringently selected high –and low– activities per peptide per kinase \\(i.e. robust sensors of kinases’ catalytic activities).\r\n\n\nf. As another method to find \\(and/or validate) peptide sensors that are most significantly associated with high activity per kinase, users can measure the ATP-consumption profiles in presence of increasing concentration of a kinase-specific inhibitor. The underlying postulate is that, when the activity of a kinase is measured in presence of an inhibitor that should inhibit its activity, then any peptide associated with a significant decrease in activity of this kinase may be considered as a suitable sensor to detect the activity of this kinase. Specifically, for any given kinase, the output of such approach can be plotted and interpreted as follow:\r\n\n\ni. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between drug concentration and ATP consumption for each peptide, as a mean to evaluate the levels of inhibition \\(to plot on the y-axis).\r\n\n\nii. Calculate the activity level per peptide in the untreated control setting \\(to plot on the x-axis).\r\n\n\niii. Calculate the correlation between data points \\(R2 \\(Fisher \\(inhibition), activity) along with significance of the association \\(p-val)), and identify which peptides report on \\(i) higher kinase activity levels \\(i.e. dots located toward the right-end of the x-axis, indicating highest ATP consumption), and \\(ii) also exhibit greater activity inhibition in presence of increasing concentrations of the kinase-specific inhibitor \\(i.e. dots located toward the bottom-end of the y-axis, indicating strongest negative correlation and thus strongest inhibition). \r\n\n\niv. These results also can help assess the utility / reliability / quality of biological peptide targets of kinases as sensors. \r\n\n\nv. This method and its logics can also be used for many other purposes such as identifying how specific a kinase-inhibitor is, or identify additional targets of a drug. \r\n\n\ng. Compare activity profiles of Tyrosine Kinases or Serine/Threonine Kinases measured in presence of any of their predicted Y- or S/T- containing biological peptides, versus any Y- or S/T- free biological or reference peptides. This can help provide a control readout of the specific activity of kinases for their reporting sensor probes."
