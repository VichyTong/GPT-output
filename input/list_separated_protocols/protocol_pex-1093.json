Filter all the supernatants collected through 0.2 µm cellulose acetate filters and concentrate them by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 16 hours at 4°C). Resuspend the viral pellets in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (1/140 of initial supernatant volume).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B) Generation of hiHepPCs from HUVECs</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;Culture HUVECs in HUVEC medium [1:1 mixture of Medium 200, supplemented with LSGS, and FibroLife S2 Comp kit]. Following HUVEC expansion in culture, cryopreserve them until they are required.</p><p>2.&nbsp;Thaw the cryopreserved HUVECs, seed them at a density of 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;cells/well in 12-well gelatin-coated plates, and culture them in HUVEC medium. After 6 hours, replace the medium with fresh medium.</p><p>3.&nbsp;Twenty-four hours after seeding (5–10% confluency), add the concentrated viral supernatants and 5 µg/ml protamine sulfate to the culture medium. After centrifuging at 800 × g for 10 minutes, incubate the plates at 37°C, with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for 6 hours. Then, replace the medium with fresh medium and incubate the plates at 37°C, with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for 18 hours.</p><p>4.&nbsp;Retrovirus infection should additionally be conducted 3 times for 3 days.</p><p>5.&nbsp;After the 4th infection, replace the medium with hepato-medium (plus), composed of a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F-12, supplemented with 20% FibroLife S2 Comp kit, 4% FBS, 1 µg/mL insulin, 10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;M dexamethasone, 10 mM nicotinamide, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 µM&nbsp;b-mercaptoethanol, 20 ng/mL rhHGF, 1 µM A8301, 2 µM SB431542, 5 µM Y-27632, and penicillin/streptomycin.</p><p>6.&nbsp;After 48 hours, replate the transduced HUVECs on&nbsp;type I collagen-coated&nbsp;6-well plates, then passage them every 7 days.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>C) Generation of hiHepPCs from HPBECs</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;HPBECs are obtained from adult human peripheral blood, as described previously<sup>9,10</sup>.</p><p>2.&nbsp;Seed HPBECs at 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;per well of&nbsp;type I collagen-coated&nbsp;48-well plates and culture them in HPBEC medium [EGM-2MV BulletKit (Lonza), supplemented with 10% FBS and 50% FibroLife S2 Comp kit]&nbsp;until they reached 20–30% confluency.</p><p>3.&nbsp;Perform viral infection (FOXA3, HNF1A, and HNF6, with or without L-MYC), according to the protocol for generating hiHepPCs from HUVECs.</p><p>4.&nbsp;Additionally, perform 7 more retrovirus infections for 7 days.</p><p>5.&nbsp;After the 8th infection, replace the medium with a 1:1 mixture of HPBEC medium and hepato-medium (plus).</p><p>6.&nbsp;After 2 days, replace the medium with hepato-medium (plus), and ensure that the medium is replaced with fresh medium every week.</p><p>7.&nbsp;More than 1 month after the final infection, slowly expanding epithelial cell colonies appear in culture. After these colonies appear compact, perform the passage of cells.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>D) Induction of hiHepPC differentiation into hepatocytes</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;Seed hiHepPCs at 5 × 10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;per well of PrimeSurface ultra-low attachment 96-well plates coated with poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, as described previously<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;and culture them in a medium composed of a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F-12, supplemented with 1 µg/mL insulin, 10 mM nicotinamide, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 µM&nbsp;b-mercaptoethanol, 20 ng/mL rhHGF, 1 µM Forskolin, 1 µM A8301, 20 µM Y-27632, and penicillin/streptomycin.</p><p>2.&nbsp;hiHepPC aggregates are observed 1 day after 3D culture initiation.
