The optimal amount of DNA for tumoral samples was defined empirically by using different quantities of DNA from tumors with a previously measured VCN. Since we expect the tumors to be mono or oligoclonal, we chose the minimal DNA quantity that resulted in the generation of few discrete bands, each representing a different LV insertion   <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2446/original/Figure_1.pdf?1359456696\" >\\(Fig.1)</a>.   \r\n\n\nAccording to these criteria, for tumor samples we used different amounts of DNA as template for LAM-PCR, according to the VCN that was detected in the sample by qPCR: 100 ng if VCN < 1; 50 ng if VCN ≥ 1 and ≤ 3; 10 ng if VCN >",
