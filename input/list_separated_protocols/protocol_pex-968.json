"\n<p><strong>On the day preparations: (allow 2-3 hours)</strong></p><p><strong><u>Solutions &amp; preparation of materials:</u></strong></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>1% formaldehyde solution is made freshly from paraformaldehyde (PFA). Note that PFA is a polymer of formaldehyde that must be hydrolyzed to be functional. This is done by heating the aqueous solution (60°C) and increasing the pH with NaOH.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 0.25 g of PFA&nbsp;to 22.5 ml of double-distilled water in a 50 ml conic tube. Add one drop of 1 M NaOH. Incubate in 60°C water bath for at least 20 minutes. Invert every 5 minutes or so to ensure all PFA is dissolved.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow solution to cool to room temperature before adjusting the pH to 9.2 using 50mM boric acid (usually takes about 0.5 ml).</p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 35 µl of Triton X-100 (0.15% final v/v). Make sure is completely dissolved before use. Triton X-100 is a nonionic detergent that bursts the nuclear envelope. This is done concomitantly with the formaldehyde fixation step.</p><p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 150 µl of a 500 mM solution of DTT&nbsp;to the fix (final concentration: 3 mM DTT)</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Thaw out Tyrode’s solution aliquot and pre-warm to 37°C</strong>.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-warm aliquot (approx. 1 ml) of 0.9% sodium citrate solution to 37°C.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare a humid chamber with hot water before beginning protocol.</p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Etch and clean microscope slides. Use a diamond pen to draw a circle in the middle on the <u>underside</u> of the slide where you will drop the oocyte. Use ethanol or IMS to wipe the slides to remove grease using standard laboratory tissue wipes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Procedure:</u></strong></p><p>The following steps are carried out under the stereomicroscope on a heated stage.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the slides in a Coplin jar containing in 1% formaldehyde solution to coat the slide.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a 130 µm micropipette, transfer the MI or MII oocyte to a 30 µl drop of Tyrode’s solution on the lid of a culture dish. Gently pipette the oocyte up and down to move the oocyte in the solution.&nbsp;Watch for the loosening and eventual sloughing of the zona under a stereomicroscope.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the zona sloughs off, carefully transfer the eggs though 2-3 drops of 0.9% sodium citrate to rinse off the Tyrode’s solution.</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up and hold the oocyte in the micropipette in the smallest amount of liquid possible.</p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your other hand remove slide from the formaldehyde, dab the end on a paper towel and wipe the back to remove excess solution, and place under the stereomicroscope.</p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While looking under the stereomicroscope, drop the oocyte onto the formaldehyde-soaked slide within the etched circle, transferring the least amount of wash solution possible.&nbsp;Watch for the oocyte to visibly burst when it hits the slide.&nbsp;The oocyte will look to flatten and ‘crack open’, followed by a visible dispersion of the cytoplasm.&nbsp;Once completely burst the oocyte will be nearly invisible on the slide.</p><p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking care to keep the slide absolutely flat, transfer it to the pre-warmed humid chamber (37 °C) for gradual drying for a minimum of two hours at room temperature.</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After slow drying, crack the lid of the humid chamber and leave until slides are fully dry at room temperature (approx. 20 minutes).</p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move slides to a Coplin jar containing a 1% Photoflo solution (500 µL in 50 mL of water) and wash for 2 minutes.</p><p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove slides and air dry.&nbsp;Slides may dry standing vertically against any surface to allow excess liquid to run to the end of the slide or lying flat on paper towels.&nbsp;Leave at room temperature on the bench until completely dry (approx. 10-20 min).</p><p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Store slides -20°C until ready for staining.</p>"
