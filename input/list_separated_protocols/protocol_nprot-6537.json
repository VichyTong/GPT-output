Specifically, large populations of L1-stage animals \\(2-5 millions) were obtained by culturing on solid 15 cm peptone agar plates seeded with 3 ml of concentrated, streptomycin resistant _E. coli_ strain HB101. Obtaining such numbers of animals typically required expansion for three generations starting from a few small plates. Worms were synchronized at the L1 stage at every generation using the standard bleaching protocol \\(Sulston, J. E. & Hodgkin, J., 1988).\r\n\n\nImportant numbers for _C. elegans_ experiments:  \r\n\n\n• Plate 80,000-90,000 L1s on each 15 cm peptone agar plate seeded with 3ml of concentrated HB101.\r\n\n\n• It takes 3 days at 20˚C after plating L1s to obtain gravid adults for the next round of bleaching.\r\n\n\n• Aim to harvest 2-5 million L1s \\(from roughly 10-15 15 cm plates) by centrifugating, removing all water, resuspending in 600 μl TRizol and flash freezing in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Proceed to RNA isolation or store at -80˚C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor mime-seq experiments using _Drosophila melanogaster_, fly lines were maintained by periodically transferring new adult flies to fresh media. Flies were kept in an incubator at 25˚C with constant humidity. In order to collect flies for the experiments:\r\n\n\n• Specific crosses were set up between muscle Gal-4 driver stocks and UAS::Ath-HEN1 stocks. At the same time, the control fly lines were transferred to fresh medium to ensure hatching at the same time as crosses. \r\n\n\n• After 3 days, the F<sub>0</sub> flies were removed from the cross-vials. The eclosed F<sub>1</sub> flies were collected over 3 days and placed into fresh vials to be aged for 2 days. The flies were sexed and genotyped at the same time."

For experiments conducted in the wild-type background, where the endogenous methyltransferases \\(Cel-HENN-1 or Dme-HEN1) are still present, we had to subtract the background methylation that occurs on some miRNAs. In order to do this, we included an interaction term between genotypes \\(e.g. ASE::Ath-HEN1 and non-transgenic N2, and similarly for the muscle experiment done in both backgrounds) and treatments in the design formula of DESeq2 to obtain miRNAs that are not only enriched due to treatment but also show higher enrichment than in the background methylation."
