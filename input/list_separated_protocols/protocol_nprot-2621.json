The aluminium angle box and CCD camera should be placed in a corrugated cardboard box to keep the mice under the imaging system \\(Fig. 1B). The small aluminium angle box, CCD camera, and light source should be put in the light tight box to block out stray light from the experiment room. Place the stainless steel box under the CCD camera.\r\n  _Critical: To allow soft illumination into the stainless steel box, reduce the light power \\(using an ND filter or something similar), attach a light diffuser to spread the light, and turn the output end of the light source toward the roof of the shade curtain._\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nC) Construction of an alternative shutter control system\r\n\n\nCCD cameras have a “read-out time” to transfer signals to the AD converter. Therefore, the exposure time signal sequence has a square wave of “exposure on” and “exposure off” signals. The exposure time out signals from the CCD camera are used as the “trigger” signals for the multi-function wave generator that can generate a trigger input for the shutter \\(Fig. 1C). An oscilloscope is used to monitor the timing signals."

The output signals of the multi-function generator should be connected to another channel of the oscilloscope to simultaneously monitor the exposure out signals.\r\n  _Critical: The parameters described above generate “one pulse” signals in response to the exposure time out signals of the CCD camera. The more important parameters are duty ratio and phase. Because the shutter device has both electrical and mechanical jitter \\(the delay time from ideal time signals), phase and duty ratio adjustments are required to prevent light leaking into another exposure time. Changing the duty ratio changes the duration time of the “turning on” time during exposure. Phase adjustment may be required to avoid pulse generation during another exposure time. However, if the shutter is mechanical, the jitter lasts several for microseconds. In that case, turning on and off the shutter timing may be ignored. If the light control will be performed by faster devices, such as LED power modulation, phase adjustment is essential<sup>6</sup>. Instead of adjusting the duty ratio, the frequency can be changed._"
