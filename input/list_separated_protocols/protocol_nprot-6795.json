The concentration is\r\n\n\nrealized with Amicon Column Ultra 0.5 100 kDa cutoff \\(500 μL volume). The column is first washed\r\n\n\nwith PBS buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 g. The antibody solution \\(100 μg of antibody) is\r\n\n\nloaded on the column and centrifuged at 5000 g until the volume recovered is about 100 μL. If the\r\n\n\nvolume of antibody is larger than 500 μL, a second loading of the column and a second step of\r\n\n\ncentrifugation can be realized. The antibody solution is recovered and the concentration measured\r\n\n\nusing nanodrop. Briefly, the pedestal of the nanodrop is washed with water and a blank is\r\n\n\nperformed with PBS buffer. 1μL of the sample is loaded and measured."

Characterization of docking strand-imaging probe crosstalk\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFor proper multiplexed imaging, it’s important to ensure each imaging probe binds\r\n\n\nspecially to the corresponding docking strand on the antibody and has minimal crosshybridization\r\n\n\nto other docking strand present in the sample. Cross-hybridization will cause\r\n\n\nthe signal from one target to be present in the image of another target \\(similar to the\r\n\n\nbleed-through or crosstalk in the conventional fluorescence microscopy). The crosstalk\r\n\n\nlevel between two docking strands A and B depends on a number of factors, including\r\n\n\nthe densities of the each docking strand in the sample, and the melting temperatures of\r\n\n\nthe complementary duplexes \\(A-A and B-B) and non-complementary duplexes \\(A-B and\r\n\n\nB-A). Thus it is best to characterize the crosstalk in as similar setting as possible that the\r\n\n\nmultiplexed imaging will be performed. We use the protocols below to test the crosstalk\r\n\n\nbetween each docking strand-imaging probe pair in a cell-based assay.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\na.
