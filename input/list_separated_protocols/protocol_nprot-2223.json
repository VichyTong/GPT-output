    "\nFor the complete detailed protocol, see PDF file \"sop-flow-cytometry-invasion-assay.pdf\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1964/original/sop-flow-cytometry-invasion-assay.pdf?1319107440\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPart A – Labeling target RBC\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe choice of fluorescent label for target RBC is dependent on the choice of DNA dye, which itself depends on the flow cytometer that will be used to acquire the data at the end of the invasion assay. The fluorescence emission peak of CFDA SE is approximately 517nm, close to SYBR Green I at about 520nm. CFDA SE can thus only be used in combination with Hoechst 33342. The fluorescence emission peak of DDAO SE is close to 657nm. So, it can be used in combination with either Hoechst 33342 or SYBR Green I.",
