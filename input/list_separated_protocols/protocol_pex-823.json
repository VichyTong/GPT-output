Allow to incubate in the dark at room temperature, with or without gentle rotation, for 5-10 minutes.</p><p>14.&nbsp;Add 20 uL diluted, stained sperm to Fuchs-Rosenthal C-chip hemocytometer and count the number of sperm present in 5 big squares under green fluorescent light. (Sperm appear as bright fluorescent dots; un-decondensed sperm are compact dots while sperm at this state, after decondensation, are bigger circles.) Sperm concentration per microliter is the number of sperm in 5 big squares multiplied by 100.
