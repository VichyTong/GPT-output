We placed template amplicons between 41 bases and 407 bases away from the target amplicon. Each fluorogenic hydrolysis probe should be designed to anneal within its cognate amplicon but distal to the Cas9•sgRNA cutsite, such that indels resulting from repair of DSBs will not interfere with probe binding. \r\n  1.1.
