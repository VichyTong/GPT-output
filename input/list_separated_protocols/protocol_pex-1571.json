    "\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take hPSCs cultured on 6-well plates in mTeSR1 medium at 80–90% confluence.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the medium and add 1 mL of room-temperature Accutase to each well. Put the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2&nbsp;incubator and wait for 8 min.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 1 ml of mTeSR1 into each well and pool all of the cells in a 15-ml conical tube. Count the total cell number with a hemocytometer. Centrifuge the cells at 200<em>g</em>&nbsp;for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells in mTeSR1 + 10 μM Y27632, and replate at a cell density ranging from 1.3 × 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;cells/cm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to 2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;cells/cm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;onto Matrigel-coated 24-well ibidi u-plate. This time point corresponds to day −2 of differentiation.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day, aspirate the medium in each well and replace it with 2 mL of fresh room temperature mTeSR1 medium. Repeat this medium replacement until day 0 before initiating differentiation.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On differentiation day 0, initiate cardiomyocyte differentiation by change medium to RPMI + B27 minus insulin supplemented with CHIR99021 (ranging 6 μM to 12 μM ).</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 hours post treatment of CHIR99021, aspirate the medium and replace it with fresh room temperature RPMI + B27 minus insulin.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On differentiation day 3, aspirate the medium and replace it with RPMI + B27 minus insulin supplemented with 5 μM IWP2.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On differentiation day 5, aspirate the medium and replace it with RPMI + B27 minus insulin.</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On differentiation day 7, aspirate the medium and replace it with RPMI + B27. Repeat this process every other day until differentiation day 12.</p><p>10.&nbsp;Autofluorescence dynamics of NAD(P)H and FAD by OMI during the process of hPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes are recorded by an Ultima two-photon imaging system (Bruker). Cells are imaged on differentiation day 0 (immediately pre-treatment with CHIR99021, a Wnt signaling activator), day 1 (24 hours post-treatment with CHIR99021), day 3 (immediately pre-treatment with IWP2, a Wnt signaling inhibitor), and day 5 (48 hours post-treatment with IWP2). OMI is performed at these time points based on the biphasic role of Wnt signaling activation and inhibition in the cardiomyocyte differentiation protocol. The ultrafast tunable laser source enables sequential excitation of NAD(P)H at 750 nm and FAD at 890 nm. NAD(P)H and FAD emission is isolated using 440/80 nm and 550/100 nm bandpass filters (Chroma), respectively. The laser power at the sample for NAD(P)H and FAD excitation was approximately 2.3 mW and 7.9 mW, respectively. Fluorescence lifetime decays with 256 time bins were acquired across 256 × 256 pixel images with a pixel dwell time of 4.8 µs and an integration period of 60 seconds. All samples are illuminated through a 40×/1.15 NA objective (Nikon). The instrument response function was acquired from the second harmonic generated signal of urea crystals at 890 nm and was measured for each imaging session. (Figure",
