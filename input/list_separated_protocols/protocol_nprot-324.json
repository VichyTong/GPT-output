Initial signs EAU is observed approximately 7-12 days after immunization, with full-blown disease developing by post-immunization day-14. By day-21 post-immunization there is substantial reduction of inflammatory cells and disease resolution characterized by absence of inflammatory cells or inflammatory cytokines in the retina occurs 28 days post-immunization<sup>6</sup>."
