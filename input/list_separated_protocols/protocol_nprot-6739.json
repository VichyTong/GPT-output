    "\nUsages of human islets and all experiments were performed in accordance with the Sanford Research IRB. Most of the work was performed using the stereomicroscope to prevent loss of islets during transfer and washing procedures. Fixation with 4% PFA was done in the fume hood with appropriate PPE. All materials used were RNAse free. Tools and equipment were wiped with RNaseZap and then rinsed with DEPC water. Collection and disposal of waste was done using the approved disposal protocol. See flow chart for brief methodology \\(Fig.",
