Some example changes could be:\r\n\n\n- Change input data by clicking on File Reader nodes \\(positive or negative)\r\n\n\n- Change number of iterations for loop by going into Loop x-times meta-node and clicking on Counting Loop Start then setting the number\r\n\n\n- Changing sampling ratio by going into Loop x-times meta-node and in sampling meta-node changing partitioning node’s settings \r\n\n\n- Using your desired feature set; go into Loop x-times/studies. If you want to add another study with different feature set copy paste one of the meta-nodes \\(e.g. Ng) connect it in the same way as the existing ones. Right click and select Reconfigure to change meta-node name. Then go into your meta-node select filter \\(feature selection). Inside that meta-node, there are two column filter nodes; one for learning another for testing data, in these nodes select your choice of features. In classifier and CombineLearnedStats meta-nodes you should do renaming since they would be set to Ng in this instance. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPrediction\r\n\n\nThe prediction workflow requires a column named \"Accession\" for joining. If your data has no such columns you can use RowID node to create unique accession values.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFigures\r\n\n\nFigure",
