Explants adhere only tenuously in the first instance and disturbance in the first few days of culture will prevent adhesion or lead to detachment. Plates should be transferred extremely cautiously between incubator and microscope or culture hood. After sufficient EPDCs have emerged, explants attach more firmly but care is still required as detachment may easily occur."
