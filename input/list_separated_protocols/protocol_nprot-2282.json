Then each well is filled up with blocking solution \\(10% BSA \\(w/v) 0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min followed by a 30 min incubation in 20 μl Antibody solution \\(anti-Dig, Roche, 1:10,000 solution of the antibody -75 mU/ml- in Blocking solution). The wells are washed twice with 100 μl of detection buffer \\(0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.5).
