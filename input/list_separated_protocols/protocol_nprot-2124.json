For reversal ofcross-links, samples were incubated at 65 &#186;C \\(350 rpm if using shaking heat block) for 6 h or over night. \\(Cover the heat block \\(i.e. withalufoil) to improve isolation of the tubes, as this will minimize condensation, which could alter the concentrations in the sample.)</p><p><b>7.

EtOH precipitation:</b></p><p>To precipitate DNA, add 1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc pH 5.2, 2.5 volumes of 100 % cold ethanol and 1 ul of 20 mg/ml glycogen as carrier. Freeze for atleast 30 min at</p><p>-80 &#186;C. Centrifuge at 13,200 rpm for 20 min at 4 &#186;C and discard supernatant. Wash the pellet with 1 ml of 70 % ethanol, centrifuge at 13,200rpm for 5 min at room temperature and discard supernatant. Air-dry the pellet and resuspend in i.e. 500 ul of DEPC nuclease-free H2O \\(AppliedBiosystems, AM9920). Store in small aliquots, i.e. 100 ul at -20 &#186;C.

ChIP eluate is analyzed using a real-time PCR instrument \\(Applied Biosystems 7500 or CFX96 Real Time System, Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green \\(AppliedBiosystems, cat no. 4309155 or Bio-Rad cat no. 170-8880) and standard settings \\(Applied Biosystems, Bio-Rad).</p><p>2. PCR is performed in duplicates and serial dilutions of purified input DNA are measured together with the immunoprecipitated DNA samples to calculatethe amount of target sequence in immunoprecipitated chromatin relative to the amount of target sequence in input chromatin.</p><p>3. With each antibody immunoprecipitation reactions were performed in triplicates and for each PCR fragment, the amount of DNA in theimmunoprecipitated material was expressed as percentage DNA present in the input material.</p><p>4. Primer sequences for control regions and Ubx PRE can be found also in Papp and Muller, 2006, Genes Dev, 20, 2041-54.</p><p><b>General notes:</b></p><p>a) Always use Complete protease inhibitor cocktail and PMSF from lysis onwards \\(except for the last two TE washes).</p><p>b) Rotate tubes during 4 &#186;C incubation steps.</p><p>c) Can use DNA-low bind Eppendorf tubes to minimize loss of DNA during storage.</p><p>d) Theoretically 14 brain disc complexes should suffice for one ChIP reaction. However, if chromatin is prepared from very little tissue ChIPs yieldlower amounts of DNA. Therefore, we always prepare larger batches of chromatin with high DNA concentration during lysis and sonication that are thendiluted for the ChIP reactions.</p></div>"
