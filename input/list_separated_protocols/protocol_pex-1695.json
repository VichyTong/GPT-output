To each of these tubes, add 1.5 uL of the matching complex from step 1, 1.5 uL of 2X CB + PI, and 1.5 uL of the desired antibody. (Multiply these volumes for the number of replicates, if applicable.) Mix by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cell Permeabilization (30 min)</strong></p><p><em>See Appendix C in the supplemental file for instructions on preparing crosslinked cells. If using frozen crosslinked cells, thaw a cell pellet equivalent to 1 million cells on ice and proceed immediately to step 4 below.</em></p><p><em>If starting with fewer than ~1 million cells, scale the final volume used in step 7 appropriately.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer 1 million cells to a clean 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 500 *g.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the supernatant and suspend the pellet in 1 mL of freshly prepared RIPA Buffer. Incubate the tube at room T for 10 min to lyse the cells and decondense the chromatin.</p><p><em>Note: a swinging-bucket rotor is strongly recommended for the remaining centrifugations!</em></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin down the cells at 850 *g for 2 min. Carefully remove the supernatant, leaving ~50 uL at the bottom to avoid loss of cells.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspend the cells in 1 mL of Wash Buffer. Repeat the centrifugation and carefully remove the supernatant down to ~50 uL</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspend the cells in 1 mL of Wash Buffer. If you started with fewer than ~1 million cells, make sure the final cell concentration is equivalent.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Complex Binding and Tagmentation (2 hours)</strong></p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Label a 1.5 mL tube for each sample. Transfer a 50 uL cell aliquot (~50 thousand cells) into each tube. Add 4.5 uL of the matched AB-Tnp complexes from step 2 for the first binding step. Mix each sample by pipetting gently. Incubate the samples at room temperature for 30 min.</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer to each tube. Rotate the tubes for 5 min at room temperature. Centrifuge the cells at 850 *g. Remove the supernatant, leaving ~50 uL at the bottom to avoid loss of cells.</p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 3 uL of 50 uM annealed blocking adapter to the sample and mix by pipetting. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.</p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 4.5 uL of the next AB-Tnp complex to each sample and mix by pipetting gently. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.</p><p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If probing more than two marks per sample, repeat steps 9 through 11 for each remaining complex.</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 500 uL of Wash Buffer to each tube and rotate the tubes for 5 min at room temperature. Centrifuge the cells at 850 *g and remove the supernatant down to ~50 uL.</p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat step 13.</p><p>15.&nbsp;Dilute the samples to ~100 uL with Wash Buffer using the volume markings on the sides of the tubes. Add 1.5 uL of 1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> to each tube of cells and gently suspend the cells by pipetting. Incubate the cells at 37°C for 60 min to allow targeted tagmentation to occur.</p><p><em>Note: extending this reaction time is not recommended as it may increase the background signal at accessible chromatin regions due to nonspecific transposase activity.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample Purification (1.5 hours)</strong></p><p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop the reactions by adding 8 uL of 0.5 M EDTA. Vortex thoroughly to mix. Incubate samples at 80 °C for 5 min.</p><p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 2 uL of 10% SDS and 1 uL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K. Incubate at 55 °C for 60 min.</p><p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purify the DNA using a MinElute PCR Purification kit (or equivalent) and an elution volume of 20 uL.</p><p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Store the purified samples at -20°C or -80°C or proceed to the following section.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Library Preparation (1 hour)</strong></p><p><em>Note: the library PCR adapters are not the same as the complex adapters used in step 1!&nbsp;Use barcoded Illumina NextEra PCR primers or equivalent.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer each ~20 uL sample to a PCR tube. To each sample, add 0.5 uL of 50 uM PCR adapter #1, 0.5 uL of 50 uM PCR adapter #2, and 20 uL of 2X NEB Phusion HF Master Mix. Mix by pipetting and amplify using the following program:</p><p>72 °C for 5 min</p><p>98 °C for 10 s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p><p>65 °C for 30 s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 15 to 17 cycles</p><p>72 °C for 15 s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p><p>72&nbsp;&nbsp;°C for 5 min</p><p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualize the PCR products using gel electrophoresis (e.g. on a 2% E-gel run for 20 min). Visible smears and bands above ~250 bp indicate a detectable signal.</p><p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excise gel slices corresponding to DNA fragment sizes between ~250 to 800 bp. Purify the PCR products using a MinElute Gel Purification Kit (or equivalent). The DNA libraries are ready for quantification, multiplexing, and sequencing.</p>"
