The following protocol developed for studies of cell-conditioned medium proteins \\(secretome) can be easily adapted to cell lysates or samples derived from other sources. The introduction of the protease of interest, its inhibition or silencing can be done at the cellular level prior to proteome collection or in vitro after the proteome has been harvested. The latter requires collection under conditions to maintain the native structure of the constituent proteins. The minimal recommended protein amount is 100 μg for each sample \\(i.e. 100 μg for control and 100 μg for protease-treated), and can generally be achieved by collecting serum free condition medium from at least 6 cell culture flasks at around 70-80% confluence \\(175 cm<sup>2</sup>, T175).",

However, higher coverage and potentially better quantification accuracy can be obtained using a 2D peptide separation system following TAILS, such as strong cation exchange chromatography to generate 10 fractions, with each then being loaded separately on the mass spectrometer.

            "Unlike most proteomics procedures, the successful outcome of TAILS negative selection is the generation and isolation of peptide \"single hits\" where a protein identification is based on a single peptide \\(i.e. only the original or neo-N-terminal peptide of each protein)<sup>32</sup>. To address this issue we set robust statistical and bioinformatics criteria. We collect 3 different biological samples for analysis that are treated and analyzed independently. High quality and accurate MS data are acquired using a Fourier-transform mass spectrometer. For the identification of protease generated neo-N-terminal peptides, database searches are performed utilizing 2 search engines. We use Mascot and X\\! Tandem. The search parameters include N-terminal and lysine dimethylation modifications. Data analysis depends on LC-MS/MS vendor-specific data formats and the choice and access to specific analysis software. We chose to analyze the data using the open source Trans-Proteomics Pipeline \\(TPP) software from the Systems Biology Institute in Seattle<sup>31</sup>, which allows input from different mass spectrometers and can incorporate MS/MS search results from different search engines including free and open-source engines such as X\\! Tandem and Omssa as well as the commonly used commercial programs Sequest and Mascot. For peptide identification we use an orthogonal validation strategy whereby the N-terminus must be dimethylated and the peptide must be within 5 p.p.m. of the expected m/z. Next, the peptides must pass PeptideProphet in the TPP with a false discovery rate of less than 1%.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAfter high confidence peptide identification and protein identification the protease substrates are then identified by a process we term hierarchical substrate winnowing<sup>26</sup>. The relative quantification \\(protease-treated vs control) of each peptide found in the database searches is analyzed using the XPRESS quantification tool included in the TPP. In this process high confidence cleavage sites must have a peptide abundance ratio \\(heavy/light, protease/control) >3. Such peptides are compiled for each of the three biological samples from the technical replicates and further validated through the TPP to generate a list of substrate candidates identified by single peptides in multiple biological samples. Only the following high ratio peptides are then selected as high confidence potential protease-generated peptides that are identified in more than one biological replicate sample, or in multiple charge states, or with and without oxidized methionine, or with and without arginine or glutamine deamidation. The rationale is that a peptide must be identified twice: either the same peptide in different samples or in different states in the same sample. It should be noted that a less stringent validation could be used when a protease with known and narrow cleavage specificity is being examined. The double identified, high confidence, high ratio neo-N-terminal peptides are then further examined to select the most biologically relevant candidate substrates for the tested protease. For proteases belonging to a family, candidate substrates can be winnowed from the candidates that are known to be cleaved by other proteases in the family, or are protein family members of a substrate cleaved by the protease.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe identification of protein naturally blocked N-terminal peptides is performed by simply altering the database search parameters \\(i.e. including peptide N-terminal acetylation or cyclization instead of dimethylation) and by utilizing protein database annotations.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe provide below examples based on data originating from a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap<sup>TM</sup> instrument \\(\".RAW\" file format) analyzed by Mascot<sup>33</sup> and X\\!

For analysis of acetylated peptides the search parameters listed above should be changed by replacing the fixed modification on peptide N-termini from dimethylation \\(+28.031300 or +34.063117) to acetylation \\(+42.010565). The rest of the parameters should remain the same.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIt was suggested that for general N-terminome mapping aiming at enrichment and identification of proteins natural N-terminal peptides, the validation of \"single hits\" could also rely on the actual position of the identified peptide within the protein sequence<sup>13,15</sup>. Obtaining peptide positional information is dependent on the quality of the database annotation. To assist in obtaining the positional information of identified peptide we recommend the usage of a documented Perl script developed in our lab that can be found at \"www.clip.ubc.ca/resources/index.html\":http://www.clip.ubc.ca/resources/index.html, under CLIP-PICS<sup>36</sup>."
