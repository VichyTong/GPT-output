Use the other pair of forceps to pinch a bit of abdominal cuticle and pull, revealing the pair of white opaque ovaries. Repeat this step for all the flies individually and collect the ovaries in the Schneider’s medium cocktail.\r\n\n\n\\(v) With one pair of forceps hold the posterior part of the ovary \\(at around 1/3rd distance from the posterior tip) where the older egg chambers are located.  With other pair of forceps hold the anterior tip of the ovary that contains the germarium and very early stage egg chambers.\r\n\n\n\\(vi) Very… very slowly pull the germarium or early stage egg chambers with the forceps at the anterior end of the ovary. As you pull, you will see the string of egg chambers \\(of different stages) slowly pop out of the muscular sheath.  For each ovary you can repeat this step a couple of times. Be sure to avoid touching any egg chamber that has already been removed from ovary. My rule of thumb is not to allow the forceps anywhere near the dissected egg chambers.\r\n\n\n\\(vii) When you dissect you might get some later stage egg chambers still attached to the stage",
