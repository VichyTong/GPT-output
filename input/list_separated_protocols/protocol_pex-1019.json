"\n<p><strong><em>Metabolic labeling</em></strong></p><p>1. Culture K562 cells at 37°C to approximately 50% confluence in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S&nbsp;(e.g., 5 mL of 5x10<sup>5</sup>cells/mL in 6 well tissue culture plates).</p><p>2. Make 1 M 4-thiouridine (4sU) stock by dissolving the powder in DMSO. For metabolic RNA labeling, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with non-toxic concentrations of 4sU (e.g. 200 μM for mESCs).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The 4sU stock is stable for a few months at -20°C, and protect the 4sU stock solution from light.If the labeling time is longer than 4 hours, regular exchange of fresh 4sU-containing media (i.e. every three hours) can enhance 4sU incorporation (Herzog et al. 2017).</p><p>3.&nbsp;Remove media at the time-points of interest, prepare cell suspension or cryo-preserve (methanol fixation and rehydration) cells as described below.</p><p>4. Methanol-fixation (Optional):</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Methanol-fixation and rehydration were adapted from Alles&nbsp;et al (2017).</p><p>a. Fixation the cells (0.5~1.5 million in 200&nbsp;μL&nbsp;DPBS) by adding 800&nbsp;μL&nbsp;methanol&nbsp;drop-wise&nbsp;(with P1000 pipette), while gently stirring the cell suspension with the tip.

Store at -80°C&nbsp;for up to one month.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Droplet microfluidics</em></strong></p><p>5. Rehydration&nbsp;(Optional):</p><p>a. Spin down the cells at 800x g for 5 min at 4°C.</p><p>b. Remove the methanol-PBS solution without disturbing the pellet.</p><p>c. Resuspend the cells with 1 ml of DPBS-0.01% BSA (with 0.5% RNase-inhibitor).&nbsp;</p><p>d. Count the cells with Countess II.&nbsp;</p><p>e. Dilute the cells with either DPBS-0.01% BSA or SSC cocktail to 100 cells/μL.</p><p>6. Proceed to standard Drop-Seq protocol to capture new and old RNAs on barcoded beads (Macosko et al, 2015).</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Chemical conversion of 4sU in mRNAs captured on barcoded beads</em></strong></p><p>7. After droplet breakage, the barcoded beads are treated with TimeLapse-Seq chemistry (Schofield&nbsp;et al, 2018) to convert 4sU to cytidine-analog on new RNAs. </p><p>a. Briefly, 50,000-100,000 beads were washed once with 450 μL washing buffer (1 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2)).</p><p>b. The beads were resuspended with a mixture of TFEA (600 mM), EDTA (1 mM) and sodium acetate (pH 5.2, 100 mM) in water.&nbsp;</p><p>c. A solution of 192 mM NaIO<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;was then added (final concentration: 10 mM) and incubated at 45°C for 1 hour with rotation.&nbsp;</p><p>d. The beads were washed once with 1 mL TE, then incubated in 0.5 mL 1 X Reducing Buffer (10 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) at 37°C for 30 min with rotation, , followed by washing once with 0.3 mL 2X RT-buffer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>scNT-Seq library preparation and sequencing</em></strong></p><p>8. Reverse transcription and downstream library preparation steps were performed as previously described in Drop-Seq (Macosko et al, 2015).</p><p>9. After determine the optimal number of PCR cycles with an aliquot of 6,000 beads, we prepared PCR reactions with rest of barcoded beads collected for each scNT-Seq run, adding 6,000 beads per PCR tube, and ran the TSO-PCR program to enrich the cDNA. We then tagmented cDNA using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina), starting with 550-1,000 pg of cDNA pooled from all PCR reactions for a given run. Following cDNA tagmentation, we further amplified the library with 12 enrichment cycles using the Illumina Nextera XT i7 primers along with the P5-TSO hybrid primer (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGCCTGTCCGCGGA AGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT*A*C).</p><p>10. After quality control analysis using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent), libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument using the 75-cycle High Output v2 or v2.5 Kit (Illumina). We loaded the library at 2.0 pM and added Custom Read1 Primer (GCCTGTCCGCGGAAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC) at 0.3 μM to position 7 of the reagent cartridge. Paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer as described previously (Hu et al 2017). The sequencing configuration was 20 bp (Read1), 8 bp (Index1), and 60 bp (Read2).</p>"
