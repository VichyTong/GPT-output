Keep flask level so media can cover all cells. Swirl flask around to mix. Place back in 37°C incubator overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 7:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Change media 24h after transfection and let incubate for another 48h before harvesting.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 9:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Transfer all media from flask \\(take from top corner and do not touch cells) into 50 mL conical. Dispose of the empty flask.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Spin tubes at 800g for 5 min at 4°C \\(to get rid of cells).\r\n\n\nStep 3: Transfer supernatant to another 50mL conical \\(leave behind pellet + 1mL) \r\n\n\nStep 4: Transfer to 30 mL syringe and filter through 0.45 um filter into ultra-high spin tubes. Then place on ice.\r\n\n\nStep 5: Clean ultracentrifuge rotors with 70% ethanol and dry out.\r\n\n\nStep 6: Load ultra-high spin tubes into the rotor. Note the rotor holds 6 tubes so if you have less than 6 samples fill the other tubes with PBS for balance.\r\n\n\nStep 7: Weigh each tube to ensure difference between each tube is no more than 0.1g.\r\n\n\nStep 8: Use ultra-centrifuge to spin down supernatant containing lentivirus. We use SW-28 rotor, speed 20,000 rpm, time 2 hours, and temperature 4°C.\r\n\n\nStep 9: Thaw out SFEM media at room temp meanwhile.\r\n\n\nStep 10: After centrifugation step, take out tubes and put on ice.\r\n\n\nStep 11: Invert tubes and dispose of supernatant.\r\n\n\nStep 12: Dry ultra-spin tube on top of Kim wipe \\(keep inverted) for 5 min.\r\n\n\nStep 13: Add 1 mL of SFEM \\(without cytokines) along the side of the tube \\(do not disturb bottom).\r\n\n\nStep 14: Parafilm to cover the top tightly, place tube on rack inside a Styrofoam box. Fill box with ice, make sure virus tube embedded in the ice.\r\n\n\nStep 15: Put on horizontal shaker in the cold room on super low shaking speed and let shake overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 10:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Pre label cryovial to freeze lentivirus.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Gently resuspend virus in 1mL SFEM \\(set pipette at 500 uL), be careful not to create bubbles. Transfer all of volume into labeled cryovial, aliquot out 5 microliter into an Eppendorf, and freeze the rest down in -80°C freezer.\r\n\n\nStep 3: Plate 293x cells in 96 well flat bottom in DMEM 10% FBS at 25,000 cell per well in 100 microliter.\r\n\n\nStep 4: Add on top polybrene in 100 microliter DMEM 10% FBS such that polybrene final concentration in the well is 10 ug/mL.\r\n\n\nStep 5: For each lentivirus plate 2, 0.2, and 0.02 microliter of virus. Make sure to leave a few blank control well.\r\n\n\nStep 6: Mix wells up and down and place in 37°C tissue culture incubator overnight.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 11:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Change media on the 293x-viirus titer plate.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDay 13:\r\n\n\nStep 1: Trypsinize cells to detach, neutralize with media, and plate in a 96 well V bottom plate.\r\n\n\nStep 2: Read out the Vex+ % \\(AmCyan channel), gating on a blank sample, for the different titrations.\r\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate your lentivirus titer. Calculation is typically done on the dilution of virus that leads to a Vex+% between 1-20%. For example, assume 0.2 microliter leads to 16% Vex. Equation is: 16% *25000/Volume of virus = Viral titer. So calculating this one: 3200/.2 microliter = 16,000,000 particles/mL."
