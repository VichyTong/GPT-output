        "body": "LVs are produced as described previously12. At the final step, the viruses are resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline \\(DPBS) solution. The biological titer of lentiviral vectors is determined by the infection of HEK-293 cells with different virus dilutions. Usually a minimum titer of 105 – 106 TU/ml is required for efficient infection. \r\n  TIP: It is important that the viral particles are stored in small aliquots at –80ºC. The virus suspension can be stored at -80ºC for at least 1 year without significant change in virus titer. Do not re-freeze virus solution after thawing. The virus solution can be stored at 4ºC if an experiment is planned within a week.\r\n\n\nCaution: Lentiviruses are capable of infecting human cells including non-dividing cells through contact. Gloves and protective clothing are required for working with lentiviruses. Extra caution should be taken to avoid spill and splash when handling lentivirus-containing material. Lentiviruses are labile and easily decontaminated by ethanol, detergent or bleach. Working area should be decontaminated with ethanol or bleach after any spill and after any experiments involving virus handling are completed. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn vivo transduction of the desired gene in the testis\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCAUTIONS All animal studies should be performed with relevant institutional guidelines, permissions and regulations. Handle animals with institutionally approved ethical procedures and avoid stress to the animals. All steps described below should be performed in a sterile laminar flow hood."

Anterior to the penis, make a single midline cutaneous incision of approx. 1-1.5 cm length using sterile surgical scissors under aseptic conditions. A central incision is the preferred surgical approach to get adequate access to both testes with a single cut."

Trypan blue is added for monitoring the accuracy of the delivery in the testis. \\(Fig.1b)."

The total volume of viral suspension injected into the testis should not be more than 20 µl. Injecting large volumes of lentivirus may rupture the testis as might injecting the testis more than once.."

Try to be careful when you handle the testis, so as to not crush it."

Hence, transgenic sperm produced after 30 days of LV injection presumably originates from the spermatogonial cells in which permanent integration of the transgene occurs at the time of LV injection."
