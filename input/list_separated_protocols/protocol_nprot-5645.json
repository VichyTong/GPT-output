Make sure that they are fasted 36 to 48hrs but sufficient water should be guaranteed in case of accidental death. The surgical instruments sterilized under high heat and pressure should be placed in the tray spread with a disposable sterile towel prior to the operation. The heating panels and small animal electrotome should be fixed in advance. Then, turn on the air conditioning to maintain the operation room at 25°C/50-70% RH. Finally, switch on the shadowless surgical operating lamp. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n_Intraoperative operation_\r\n\n\n\\(1) Anesthetize and weigh the fasted male rabbits. The rabbits are anesthetized by injecting 1% sodium pentobarbital solution \\(3ml/kg body weight) in the rabbit’s right ear marginal vein through 20 ml syringe and scalp acupuncture. After the conjunctival reaction disappears or becomes dull, clamp reflex also disappears, the rabbits are all anesthetized with stable breathing and the body tension is reduced. Fix the scalp acupuncture, establish vein channel, and give intravenous injection of 5% glucose solution at 5s/drop.
