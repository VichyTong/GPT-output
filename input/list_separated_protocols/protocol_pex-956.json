The quarantined individuals Q indicated the confirmed cases who were centrally quarantined. The epidemic spreading model for the SEIQ model is shown in Figure 1.</p><p>The transmission dynamics are governed by the following system of equations:</p><p><br></p><p>Eq(1) (Equation can not be displayed here, please refer to supplementary file)</p><p><br></p><p>where N = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + Q(t) is the total population, which is assumed consistent.</p><p>Like the SEIR model, parameter β indicates the infectious rate with β = Rt/TE where R<sub>t</sub> is the dynamic effective reproduction number and TE is the average duration of incubation; parameter σ indicates the incubation rate with σ = 1/TE. However, in our model, parameter γ indicates the quarantine rate with γ = 1/TI (where TI is average duration of an infectious individual to be detected and quarantined). The parameter TI may vary across different regions and the difference reflects the timeliness of patient detection and admission.</p><p>The basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> is the most important parameter to determine the intrinsic transmissibility of COVID-19, and it is defined as the average number of infections one infectious agent can generate over the course of the infectious period without any interventions. R<sub>0 </sub>was assumed to be a constant or arbitrarily modified at specific points for forecasting in previous work [12, 13]. However, in real-world scenarios, with the development of epidemic, more and more interventions are often taken to control the spread, which gradually reduce R<sub>0</sub>. In this work, the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> is generalized to a dynamic value R<sub>t</sub>, which is defined as the average number of secondary infectious cases generated by an infectious at time t. After the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, many governments took considerable measures to contain the spread of the virus. In our preliminary analysis and similar to previous work [14], the infectious rate β was shown to decrease exponentially with time. As parameter TE is constant, the effective reproduction number R<sub>t</sub> should follow similar pattern as decreasing exponentially with time. Thus, we introduced time-dependent dynamics to the calculation of R<sub>t</sub> for better simulation of the real-world transmission,</p><p><br></p><p>Eq (2) (Equation can not be displayed here, please refer to supplementary file)</p><p><br></p><p>where R∞ is the final reproduction number at the end of the pandemic and θ is the decrease ratio of the reproduction number, which is associated with the corresponding interventions. When t = 0, R<sub>t</sub>=R<sub>0</sub>, and it gradually reduces to R∞.<sub><strong> </strong></sub>The epidemic is considered to be under control with R<sub>t</sub> < 1, and the reasonable range of R∞ was referred to some previous analysis of coronavirus.</p><p><strong>Parameter constraints and optimization</strong></p><p>The simulation and prediction of the D-SEIQ model requires determination of the parameters R<sub>0</sub>, R∞，TE, TI, θ. Although we incorporated machine learning to help us to fit the reported data, the parameter range needs to be set carefully and to conform to epidemiological rationality. For instance, Wu et al. applied an adjusted SEIR model to estimate R<sub>0</sub> (R<sub>0</sub>= 2·68) in major cities of China by analyzing the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally. Some work concluded that the daily reproduction number varied between 2 and",
