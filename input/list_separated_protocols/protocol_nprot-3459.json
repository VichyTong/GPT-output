Between 30 and 50.10e7 cells are expected for one tandem ChIP experiment.\r\n\n\n- The first day of the procedure, 2 h before starting the protocol, check the aspect and confluence of ES cells. Change the ES cell medium, using precisely 10 ml of fresh medium per 10 cm dish, and further incubate the cells for 2 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. \r\n\n\n- Set a water bath at 37°C, and refrigerate the centrifuge \\(e.g. 5810R eppendorf centrifuge, with an A-4-62 rotor).
