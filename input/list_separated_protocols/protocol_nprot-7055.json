This is a standard format for read data that is generated by most sequencing technologies.  The software we use to deconvolute the barcode information takes the FASTQ file and expects 42 bases of the barcode and common adapter sequence to be appended to the end of the first read.  It matches the barcode read data to the expected 1536 sequences at each barcode position.  The barcoding strategy used by stLFR enables error correction of barcodes that have a single base mismatch.  The final output from our software is a FASTQ file with the barcode information appended to the end of the read ID with the format #Barcode1ID_Barcode2ID_Barcode3ID, where BarcodeID is a number from 0-1536.  Zero for a barcode ID means it did not match any of the expected barcode sequences.  The software can be downloaded here https://github.com/stLFR/stLFR_read_demux.  We recommend using BWA-mem \\(Li and Durbin 2009) for mapping, GATK \\(McKenna et al. 2010) for variant calling, and HapCUT2 \\(Edge et al. 2017) for phasing.  We also recommend mapping to Hg19 with decoy sequences."
