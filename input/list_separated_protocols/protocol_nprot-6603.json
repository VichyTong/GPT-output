            "Dissection.\r\n\n\n2.1) Take a petri dish and coat it with a thin layer of petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly allows to immobilize the flies. \r\n\n\n2.2) Paste flies dorsal side down with the wings outstretched \\(Fig 1A). \r\n\n\n2.3) Put the scissors behind the third pair of legs with an angle of 45º with respect to the surface of the petri dish and cut to remove the head, the legs and part of the thorax.\r\n\n\n2.4) Add oxygenated artificial hemolymph and cut the genial portion to create an opening. \r\n\n\n2.5) Introduce the scissors through the previous opening and cut through the whole abdomen to the thorax. As a result, abdomen splits in two halves. \r\n\n\n2.6) Use forceps to take out the intestine, reproductive organs and fat \\(Fig 1B). After this step, the heart and the nephrocytes should be tightly attached to the dorsal cuticle. \r\n\n\n2.7) With a suction pump and a patch pipet, take out any extra fat or non-cardiac tissue remnants near the heart without touching the organ \\(Fig 1C). Finally, replace the hemolymph with new one. The preparation can be used for approximately 1 h. Change AH hourly.\r\n\n\nNOTE. Female flies are easier to dissect because of their bigger size.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL. Take extra care removing fat surrounding the heart. If you physically touch the heart, the preparation must be discarded because it compromises the reliability of the subsequent physiological analyses. Place the beating hearts under bright field microscopy. Record 20 s videos of each beating heart with a high-speed camera at a frame rate of at least 160 frames/s. Videos are to be processed using the software program described in Ocorr et al. 2014, which will generate a number of cardiac parameters including heart period \\(HP), heart rate \\(HR), arrhythmia index \\(AI), systolic interval \\(SI), diastolic interval \\(DI), percentage of fractional shortening \\(%FS), end systolic diameter \\(EDD), and end diastolic diameter \\(EDD).\r\n\n\nNOTE. To ensure proper statistical power, record a minimum of 20 fly hearts per experimental condition or genotype. \r\n\n\nCRITICAL. Quality of videos is critical so ensure a good contrast of heart walls. \r\n\n\n? Troubleshooting\r\n\n\nAfter obtaining the above physiological parameters, dissected hearts can be processed for a number of downstream applications such as in situ hybridization to detect a specific transcript \\(A), immunofluorescence to detect a protein at subcellular resolution \\(B), staining with phalloidin to reveal heart muscle fibres \\(C), and molecular methods to extract RNA \\(D) or proteins \\(not described here), and to generate cDNA for transcriptome analysis \\(E). \r\n\n\nA. Fluorescence In situ Hybridization \\(FISH)\r\n\n\nIn our case, we detected CUG-RNA transcripts in control and DM1 flies. For this purpose, FISH was done with a Cy3-labeled CAG probe.",
