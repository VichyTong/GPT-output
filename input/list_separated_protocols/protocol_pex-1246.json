Adjust volume of cells in staining solution to achieve 0.5-1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells per 100 μL.</p><p>2. Block Fc receptors by adding ChromePure Rabbit IgG (final concentraion 200 µg/mL).</p><p>3. Add 10 µL of Ter119-biotin per mL of cells.</p><p>4. Incubate on ice for 30 min.</p><p>5. Wash the cells by adding 3 mL of cold staining solution.</p><p>6.

Set aside 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells (18 µL) for staining controls and make up to 1 mL with staining solution. Keep on ice.</p><p>9. Set aside 8 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells (72 µL) for unenriched sort and make up to 100 µL with staining solution. Keep on ice.</p><p>10.

Wash the cells by adding 3 mL of separation buffer.</p><p>13. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 200 rcf for 5 min (4ºC).</p><p>14.

Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 500 μL of separation buffer per 10<sup>8</sup> cells.</p><p>16. Place an 30 µm pre-separation filter in each LS column, and a 15 mL collection tube below the column.</p><p>17. Apply 500 µL of resuspended cells to each LS column, collecting the flow through which contains Ter119-negative progenitor cells.</p><p>18. Wash each column twice with 1 mL of separation buffer, allowing the first mL to flow through before adding the second.</p><p>19. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 200 rcf for 5 min (4ºC).</p><p>20. Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 100 μL of staining buffer.</p><p>21.

Using staining solution, adjust the volume of Ter119-negative cells in staining solution to achieve 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells per 100 μL.</p><p>2. Gently resuspend staining control and unenriched cells (set aside earlier) by vortexing.</p><p>3. Aliquot staining control cells into 9 tubes of 100 µL each.</p><p>4. Prepare the Lineage cocktail by combining 3 µL of each antibody in Figure 1.</p><p>5. Add the relevant conjugated antibodies to each tube according to Figure 2.</p><p>6.

Add 1:100 of diluted Hoechst to the relevant tubes immediately prior to sorting (Figure 2).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cell sorting.</strong></p><p>1. Establish voltages and flow using unstained and single stain samples:</p><p>A. Gate cells for forward and side scatter to isolate single cells.</p><p>2.
