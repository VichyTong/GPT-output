"\nLentiviral production:\r\n\n\nLentiviruses were produced in HEK 293T cells by co-transfecting pMD2.G, pRSV-Rev and pMDLg/pRRE helper vectors together with the vector for one transcription factor using 2.5 M CaCl2. 75 μg of transcription factor plasmids was used together with 30 μg of PMDLg/pRRE, 22 μg of pMD2.G and 15 μg of pRSV-Rev plasmids for two T175 flasks. Medium was changed 16 hours after transfection and viruses were harvested 48 hours after transfection, pelleted by centrifugation \\(20,000 x g for 2 hours at 4°C) resuspended in 100 μl DMEM, aliquoted and kept at -80°C. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\niAs generation:\r\n\n\nDay -2\r\n\n\nDissociate hESC or hiPSC with Accutase and replate 5x105 cells in Matrigel-coated 6-well plates with mTeSR1 containing 10 μM Rock inhibitor.\r\n\n\nDay -1\r\n\n\nAspire medium and add 2 ml of fresh mTeSR1 containing 8 μg/ml of Polybrene per well. Add 1 μl of each virus per well.\r\n\n\nDay 0\r\n\n\nAspire medium and add 2 ml of fresh mTeSR1 containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline per well.\r\n\n\nDays 1 and 2\r\n\n\nAspire medium and add 2 ml of Expansion Medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline, 1.25 μg/ml of Puromycin and 200 μg/ml of Hygromycin per well.\r\n\n\nDay 3\r\n\n\nAspire medium and add 2 ml of 3:4 of Expansion Medium and 1:4 of FGF Medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline and 200 μg/ml of Hygromycin per well.\r\n\n\nDay 4\r\n\n\nAspire medium and add 2 ml of 1:1 of Expansion Medium and FGF Medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline and 200 μg/ml of Hygromycin per well.\r\n\n\nDay 5\r\n\n\nAspire medium and add 2 ml of 1:4 of Expansion Medium and 3:4 of FGF Medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline and 200 μg/ml of Hygromycin per well.\r\n\n\nDay 6\r\n\n\nAspire medium and add 2 ml of FGF Medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline.\r\n\n\nDay 7\r\n\n\nDissociate cells with Accutase and pellet at 300g for 5 min. Replate cells in Matrigel-coated coverslips, petri dishes or wells according to desired output. Use the necessary amount of FGF Medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline.\r\n\n\nDay 8\r\n\n\nAspire medium and add fresh FGF Medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline.\r\n\n\nDay 10\r\n\n\nAspire half of the medium and add the same amount of Maturation Medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of Doxycycline. From here, change half of the medium every 2-3 days."
