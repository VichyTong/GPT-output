ChEMBL16 is used to obtain SMILES strings for some metal-containing compounds that are lacking SMILES strings in ChEMBL22. There are typically a small number \\(usually <100) of the ‘top drug candidate’ compounds \\(for example, polymers) for which there are no SMILES in ChEMBL, so these are not included in the diversity analysis. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe pairwise similarity between the SMILES strings is calculated, and the similarities converted to distances, as for the dendrogram of known anthelmintic compounds \\(Step H). This number of compounds is too large to construct a dendrogram using hierarchical clustering. Instead, by manually examining the clusters in the dendrogram of known anthelmintic compounds \\(from Step H), we find that compounds in the same cluster generally have distances of ≤ _x_ \\(e.g. 0.65) from each other, and those in different clusters usually have distances of > _x_. Thus, a set of clusters is found by first constructing a graph in which each compound is represented by a node, and each pair of nodes is joined if the distance between the compounds is ≤ _x_; and finding connected components in this graph.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSome of the connected components in this graph may be very large and include  relatively dissimilar compounds among the known anthelmintic compounds. Therefore, we further split the connected components by using a community \\(cluster) detection algorithm to find clusters within the subgraph corresponding to each connected component. To find the communities, we use the ‘community’ Python module \\(Aynaud 2009) to find optimal communities in terms of the modularity measure \\(as described previously by Blondel _et al._ 2008), using the similarities between compounds as the edge weights. When the community detection algorithm is applied to the connected components in the graph of top drug candidates and anthelmintic compounds, it splits the components into smaller communities \\(clusters). Upon manual examination, it is usually found that some of these  clusters still contains relatively dissimilar compounds among the known anthelmintic compounds. Therefore, for each cluster, we perform hierarchical clustering in R using Ward's minimum variance method, and cut the dendrogram at a height of _y_ \\(e.g. 0.85). The value of _y_ is chosen by trying various heights, and finding the height at which anthelmintic compounds known to have similar structures \\(based on Step H) are placed in the same cluster. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe consider that the resultant clusters represent the chemical classes to which the top candidate compounds belong."
