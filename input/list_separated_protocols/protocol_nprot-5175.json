Leave the tube 15 minutes under the hood for allowing EBs to sediment at the bottom of the tube by gravity. A short spin of the tubes at a low speed \\(10 sec at 800g) may increase the number of EBs collected. Remove gently the supernatant, add fresh medium and seed EBs back on the 6-well-ultra-low attachment plates. It is important to not dissociate EBs formed by using un-appropriate pipettes. We recommend the use of 3 ml sterile Pasteur pipettes."
