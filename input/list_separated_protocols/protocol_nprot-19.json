    "\nThe Exemplar modules to be utilized are the:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1 Genetic Algorithm Module \\(GA Module) &#x2013; This module implements an Artificial Intelligence approach to finding logical combinations of SNP&#x2019;s for association based studies\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2 Association Study Module \\(AS Module) &#x2013; this module calculates many useful statistics like Chi Square, Yates, Fisher Exact, Odds Ratio, LD, D&#x2019;, etc.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3 Chromosome Alteration module \\(CA Module) &#x2013; this module performs LOH analysis on the dataset using user-specified controls as the reference set to identify possible deletions in the chromosome.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe difficulty with such a small sample size is the lack of statistical power. Nonetheless, we hoped that by performing multiple types of analysis on the data, we could reduce the problem space from ~10,000 SNP&#x2019;s to &lt;50 SNP&#x2019;s for consideration. Then, applying the biological knowledge to thus reduced set of data will further help to select genes-candidates for the studied disorder. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n",
