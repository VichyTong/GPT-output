    "\nThe two ovaries are small, round, irregular-shaped organs found on each side of the abdomen, a little below the kidney. Each ovary is attached to one uterine horn of the bicornuate uterus via a highly convoluted and tightly packed Fallopian tube \\(oviduct). In old rats the ovary is often totally obscured by fat, but this usually acts as a landmark since this fat is freely moveable. Fat attached to the midline spinal muscles is not freely moveable.",
