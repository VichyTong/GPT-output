"\n1.Seed S2 cells at a concentration of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in 100 x 20 mm tissue culture plates in 10 ml of conditioned medium \\(supplemented with 25% of the medium in which cells have been formerly grown).\r\n\n\n2.Incubate in a 28&#xB0;C incubator \\(no CO2 requirements) and split cells at 1:2 to 1:5 dilution when cell density is between 6 to 20 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml.\r\n\n\n3.If planning to perform LPS or PGN stimulation on S2 cells, pretreat cells with 1 microM 20-hydroxy-ecdysone for 24 hours before stimulation."
