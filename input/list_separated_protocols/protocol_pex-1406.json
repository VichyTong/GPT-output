"\n<p><strong>Photolithography</strong></p><p>Wafer preparation:</p><p>- Clean the wafer with acetone in an US bath for 5 minutes.</p><p>- Clean the wafer with IPA in an US bath for 5 minutes</p><p>- Remove the solvents with de-ionized water using a QDR until a resistivity of 12 MOhm cm is reached.</p><p>- Dry the wafer in a spin-rinse-dryer.</p><p>- Bake the wafer at 200 °C on a preheated hotplate for 5 minutes.</p><p>- Remove the wafer from hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spin coating:</p><p>- Place the cleaned wafer in a spin coater and dispense 4 mL of resist at the center of the substrate. Coat the wafer using the following steps:</p><p>- Time: 15 seconds; Speed: 500 r.p.m.; Acceleration: 200 r.p.m./s</p><p>- Time: 30 seconds; Speed: 3500 r.p.m.; Acceleration: 300 r.p.m./s</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Softbake:</p><p>- Bake the coated wafer at 65 °C on a preheated hotplate for 5 minutes.</p><p>- Increase the temperature of the hotplate to 95 °C and bake the wafer for additional 30 minutes.</p><p>- After a total of 35 minutes, turn off the hotplate and let the wafer cool down to 75 °C while still on the hotplate.</p><p>- Remove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Exposure:</p><p>- Measure the energy density (mW/cm2) of the UV lamp at a wavelength of 365 nm.</p><p>- Load the mask and the wafer into the mask aligner and align them.</p><p>- Expose the photoresist until an exposure dose of 260 mJ/cm2 is reached.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Post-exposure bake:</p><p>- Bake the exposed wafer at 65 °C on a preheated hotplate for 5 minutes.</p><p>- Increase the temperature of the hotplate to 95 °C and back the wafer for additional 12 minutes.</p><p>- After a total of 17 minutes, remove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Development:</p><p>- Develop the wafer in a Petri dish for 15 minutes. Move manually to improve the circulation of the developer.</p><p>- Move the wafer to a second Petri dish with fresh developer for additional 30 seconds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rinse, dry and hardbake:</p><p>- Rinse the wafer and the developed SU-8 structures with IPA.</p><p>- Rinse the wafer with de-ionized water.</p><p>- Dry the wafer with a nitrogen gun.</p><p>- Hardbake the wafer at 150 °C on a preheated hotplate for 5 minutes.</p><p>- Remove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Silane coating</strong></p><p>- Plate the wafer with the SU-8 structures next to a glass slide in a vacuum chamber.</p><p>- Add three drops (each about 50 uL) of silane on the glass slide.</p><p>- Close the chamber and start the vacuum pump.</p><p>- Once sufficiently low pressure (less than 100 mbar) is reached, turn off the vacuum pump and let silane distribute inside the chamber for 30 minutes.</p><p>- Remove the wafer from the vacuum chamber and bake it on a hotplate at 120 °C for 10 minutes.</p><p>- Remove the wafer from the hotplate and let it cool down to room temperature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PDMS casting</strong></p><p>- Mix curing agent and pre-polymer with a weight ratio of 1:10 in a disposable cup for 5 minutes.</p><p>- Place the wafer in a Petri dish inside a vacuum chamber.</p><p>- Cover the wafer with the PDMS and apply a vacuum for 30 minutes to degas the polymer and ensure proper molding of the SU-8 structures. Bleed the vacuum occasionally to accelerate the process and to prevent PDMS from overflowing the Petri dish.</p><p>- Cure the PDMS by placing the Petri dish containing the mold and the degassed polymer in an oven and bake it for 1 hour at 80°C.</p><p>- Remove the Petri dish with the cured PDMS from the oven and let it cool down to room temperature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Final steps</strong></p><p>- Cut the PDMS and peel it off the silicon wafer. If necessary, punch the connectors using a biopsy punch. For 3D access to the manipulated specimen (see associated publication), cut the fabricated PDMS channels perpendicularly.</p><p>- Clean the PDMS, especially the side containing the microchannels, with transparent adhesive tape.</p><p>- Place the PDMS (microchannels facing upwards) next to a glass slide in a plasma asher.</p><p>- Expose the glass slide and the PDMS to oxygen plasma for 30 seconds.</p><p>- Bring the exposed surfaces in contact to chemically seal the structures.</p><p>- Fix a piezoelectric transducer used for subsequent acoustic excitation on the glass slide near the PDMS structure using a suitable glue, e.g., two-component epoxy.</p>"
