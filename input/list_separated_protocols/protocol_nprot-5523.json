Since long-term storage can affect the concentration of your plasmid, determine the concentration before using it for transfection. Allow new DNA preparations to dissolve in water or buffer over night at 4°C. Insufficiently dissolved plasmid might result in incorrectly measured concentrations. In order to confirm DNA concentration measurements with devices like spectrophotometer or NanoDrop always estimate the concentration also from samples loaded on agarose gels by comparing the intensity of a band of interest with the bands from the DNA ladder."

Add puromycin in the same concentration to one of the non-infected control wells and zeocin in the same concentration to another well with non-infected cells. Infection with the reporter construct is not mandatory since transdifferentiating cells can easily be identified based on their morphology and enriched via differential trypsinization. Yet, the reporter construct can serve as an additional marker.\r\n  CRITICAL STEP: The optimal concentrations for the selection antibiotics need to be determined for every cell line and for each selection antibiotic individually. The concentration not only depends on the cell type, growth conditions and the metabolic activity of a cell but also on the medium. In order to determine the optimal concentration, the cells need to be exposed to increasing concentrations of the antibiotics. Density of the cells should not exceed 50% when the selection process starts. If too confluent the cells need to be passaged prior to selection. Fresh medium with antibiotic should be added every two days. The minimal concentration which kills all the cells within one week can be considered the optimal concentration and should be used for all experiments. Determine the optimal concentration for every new batch of your antibiotic. One can either select with both antibiotics simultaneously or consecutively. Robust cell lines are amenable for simultaneous selection. More sensitive cell lines should rather be subjected to consecutive selection. After successful selection the cells can be cultivated in medium without selection antibiotics. However, to maintain the resistant phenotype the cells may be cultivated in the presence of selection antibiotics \\(working concentration) for one week every month."

However, these melanocyte-like cells proliferate much slower than those that transdifferentiate only partially or not at all. Hence, non-transdifferentiated cells tend to overgrow the transdifferentiated cells. For this reason, differential trypsinization is used to concentrate and separate spindle-shaped cells from those with a still more keratinocytic phenotype. Differential trypsinization takes advantage of the fact of differential adhesion of melanocytes and keratinocytes, i.e. melanocyte-like cells detach much faster from the plate than keratinocytic cells."
