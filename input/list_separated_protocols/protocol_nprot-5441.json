Therefore we generally keep the machine at its lowest power setting and only vary the duration of sonication \\(duration of crystal vessel/microcentrifuge tube contact with bath content, in this case, water); this is the method we present below. Other sonicating baths may be used, however the experimenter should test sonication intensity and adjust water bath contents and crystal sample as necessary to reduce or increase ultrasonic intensity.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nB.1.
