Absorbance readings at 260 nm should fall between 0.1 and 1.0 to be accurate. An absorbance of 1 unit at 260 nm corresponds to 33 µg of bisDNA per ml (A260 = 1 = 33 µg/ml). Note: if using the QIAxpert ssDNA plug-in, an EB-blank sample has to be included, which is after measurement automatically subtracted from the OD values. Ideally, the minimal gDNA concentration is 6 ng/µl but samples as low as 2 ng/µl may be processed with risk of “Low input” invalid results. Pause point: bisDNA samples can be stored at -20°C until further use.</p><p><u> </u></p><p><u>qPCR set up, run and analysis - </u>Timing: 105 min.</p><p><br></p><p>The <em>therascreen</em> PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit must be run on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx 5plex HRM instrument using automated interpretation of results with Rotor-Gene AssayManager v2.1.

Extra volume is included to compensate for pipetting errors and to allow preparation of sufficient reaction mix for four samples tested in duplicate, plus four controls. If less samples are tested, the reaction mix can be prepared accordingly. Remember to allow for the extra volume to compensate for pipetting errors (one extra well for up to 10 wells and two extra wells for up to 20 wells).

Troubleshooting.</p><p><strong>40.     </strong>Add 4 µl sample or control material into its corresponding tube according to the setup in Figure 2 to obtain a total volume of 20 µl. Mix gently 5 times by pipetting up and down. Note: be careful to change tips between each tube to avoid false-positive results from contamination by any nonspecific template.

Troubleshooting.</p><p><strong>42.     </strong>Return all the therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR Kit components and samples to the appropriate storage conditions to avoid any material degradation. Pause point: it is highly recommended to start the run as soon as possible after the preparation, however, if the tubes are prepared but cannot be processed directly (e.g. due to instrument unavailability), it is possible to store the plate at 2–8°C and protected from light up to 24 hrs.
