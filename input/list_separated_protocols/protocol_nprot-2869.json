If the cells have not reached this type of morphology, put the dishes back into the incubator and check every ~3 minutes again until the cells are about to detach.\r\n\n\n★CRITICAL STEP: The cells should be about to detach in at most 30 minutes; do not incubate the cells in Accutase for more than 30 minutes.\r\n\n\n1.7) Gently scrap the neurons off the dish with a cell scrapper and dissociate possible clumps via gentle pipetting for 3~5 times so that the neurons are lifted into single suspended cells \\(Fig. 3c).\r\n\n\n ★CRITICAL STEP: Be slow and gentle during scraping and pipetting so that the neurons are not damaged. \r\n\n\n1.8) Add pre-warmed culture medium A \\(see REAGENT SETUP) into 15 ml or 50 ml conical tubes and transfer the cells into it. The volume of the added culture medium is 9 times of the Accutase volume utilized to lift the neurons.\r\n\n\n1.9) Spin the cells at 1000 rpm for 4 minutes to collect the cells; save a small aliquot for cell counting and viability measurement.\r\n\n\n ★CRITICAL STEP: Do not spin at much higher speed to avoid possible damage of the cells and possible precipitation of death cells or cell debris. Cell counting and viability measurement could be performed by loading the saved cell suspension onto Vi-Cell XR Cell Viability Analyzer for automatic analysis or by standard Trypan-blue staining and counting on hemocytometers.\r\n\n\n1.10) During spinning, count the cell density and viability based on Trypan-blue exclusion; the viability needs to be close or above 90%.\r\n\n\n1.11) Aspirate the medium from the conical tubes and resuspend the cells in freezing medium; calculate the volume of freezing medium so that cell density is about 5~10 X 106/ml.\r\n\n\n1.11) Aliquot the cells into cryopreservation tubes at 1ml per vial.\r\n\n\n1.12) Put the vials into the cell freezing container, and then keep the boxes into -80 oC freezer for one or more days; transfer the vials into cyropreservation boxes into liquid N2 tanks for long term storage.\r\n\n\n★CRITICAL STEP: Nalgene Cryo freezing container or similar container should be used to achieve a −1°C per minute rate of cooling when placed at −80°C."
