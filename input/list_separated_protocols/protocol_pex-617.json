"\n<p>TCA/Acetone and Chloroform: Methanol: Isopropanol(2:1:1) method of plasma protein purification:</p><p>1.200 µl plasma was taken in an eppendrof &nbsp;tube and 1mL of Chloroform: Methanol: Isopropanol( 2:1:1) was added and kept it for 15 minutes.</p><p>2. The tube was centrifuged at 12,000 rcf &nbsp;for 10 minutes at 4℃ and the supernatant&nbsp;was discarded.</p><p>3. Then, 800µl TCA/Acetone (50%) was added and&nbsp;incubated overnight at-20℃.</p><p>4. The tube was centrifuged at 12,000 rcf&nbsp;for 10 minutes at 4℃ and the supernatant was discarded.</p><p>5. 40% Ammonium sulphate was added to it and kept it for half an hour in ice .</p><p>6. Then, the tube was centrifuged at 12,000 RCF &nbsp;for 10 minutes and the supernatant was discarded.</p><p>9. Then the sample was desalted and concentrated using the 3Kd cut off column.&nbsp;</p><p>10. Then the pellet was cleaned up by Bio-rad clean up kit.</p><p>11.&nbsp;The pellet was dissolved in 150-250µl Rehydration buffer. </p><p>&nbsp;12. The sample was resolved through 10 % SDSPAGE.</p>"
