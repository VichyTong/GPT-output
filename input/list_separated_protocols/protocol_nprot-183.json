During pre-exposure and retention tests, auditory-evoked field potentials \\(AEFPs) should be recorded from both the LA and MGm/PIN \\(through the tip of the stimulation electrode), and analyzed using DataWave. Because a single trial does not provide stable enough electrophysiological recordings, no data can be collected during the reactivation trial. AEFPs can be averaged across all tone-pip presentations within a trial and collapsed across trials. The amplitude of the short latency negative component can be measured for each potential \\(<sub>12–16 ms for the LA; </sub>7–9 ms for the MGm/PIN). As in our previous study on consolidation, we assessed retention of behavioral and electrophysiological changes by expressing the change during the last four trials of the PR-LTM test as a percentage of that during the four trials of the PR-STM test. A 100% value in PR-LTM results means no change from the PR-STM test."
