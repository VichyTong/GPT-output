They were cultivated in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks with 10 mL DMEM/F12 medium. Cells were grown to confluence in the presence of humidified air, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, at 37°C. Cells were passed once per week and allowed to grow to 70% confluence \\(approximately 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells) between passages. Although the expression of mGluR1α in CHO-mGluR1α cells is thought to be constant, we checked receptor activity once per week by fura-2 based Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging<sup>17</sup> using a fraction of the cells.\r\n  \r\n\n\nITC setup before running living cells • TIMING 2 hours / week"

Next PBS is replaced with 5 mL of Versene and then the flask is placed in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 5 min. The cells are gently washed with Versene 5-6 times using an electronic pipette to remove cells from adhering to the flask and a cell suspension is generated in a 15 mL centrifuge tube \\(cells from two flasks are pooled into one centrifuge tube).
