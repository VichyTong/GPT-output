On day 6-10 after Treg cells were transferred, mesenteric lymph node cells or lamina propria cells were isolated \\(using the protocol from Current protocols in Immunology) and Annexin V and Propidium iodide staining was performed to measure apoptosis using flow cytometry.  TUNEL staining was also done on cryo-sections of the gut to measure apoptosis of the effector cells in the lamina propria of the gut followed by confocal immunofluorescence analyses."
