As the enzyme enterokinase contains traces of trypsin-like activity, the direct treatment of the wrongly-folded fusion protein may result in a C-terminally truncated form of hBD-1, which is cleaved C-terminally behind an Arg, now missing seven residues at the C-terminus. This truncated hBD-1-form is usually representing more than 80 – 90 % recovery of the whole hBD-1 after Enterokinase-treatment. We further observed that the correctly folded oxidized hBD-1 is trypsin-stable. Thus, a refolding step, generating the correctly folded hBD-1 within the fusion protein, is essential prior to enterokinase digestion. This can be performed with the two-step quick dilution method adapted from Lu et al \\[4].",

The best oxidized and correctly folded hBD-1 used for preparing the affinity column would be a chemical synthesis-derived commercially available oxidized hBD-1. When recombinant correctly folded, oxidized hBD-1 is used, take care that it does not contain any wrongly folded oxidized hBD-1. Some of the alternatively folded oxidized hBD-1 forms will be recognized by the antibodies against linearized hBD-1 – possibly due to appearance of hidden epitopes. The use of mixtures of differently folded oxidized hBD-1-forms for preparation of the affinity column will result in dramatic losses of linearized hBD-1 recognizing antibodies in the effluent.\r\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that stripping of the correctly folded hBD-1-affinity column with glycine buffer gave nearly no correctly folded hBD-1 recognizing antibodies."
