        "body": "Detection of analyte\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn activated and untreated polystyrene plates  analyte \\( human IgG, human IgE) was detected by immobilizing capture molecule \\(anti-human IgG, anti-human IgE) onto the activated and untreated polystyrene plates followed by blocking , binding  of analyte  and secondary antibody-conjugate. The plates were washed after each step. Color development was carried out by adding  substrate- dye buffer and then stopped by adding 20 Âµl of 5% Sulfuric acid  and absorbance was recorded  at 490 nm."
