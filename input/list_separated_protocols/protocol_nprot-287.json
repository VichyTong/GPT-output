Add an equal volume of chloroform to the aqueous phase, vortex and centrifuge for 2 min at 16,100g. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a fresh tube. Add 0.1 volume 3 M Na-acetate, pH 5.3, and 2.5 volumes ice-cold 96% ethanol and then vortex the sample. Store the sample at -80°C for 30 min in a cooling block or use dry ice. Centrifuge for 15 min at 16,100g at 4°C. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and slowly add 1 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol. Centrifuge for 5 min at 16,100g at room temperature. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and speedvac for 5 min to remove the last traces of ethanol. Take care not to dry the DNA too long \\(5 min maximally). Dissolve the DNA pellet in 30 μl T10E0.2 by extensively rinsing the walls of the tube with buffer. Determine the DNA concentration and purity using a spectrophotometer.
