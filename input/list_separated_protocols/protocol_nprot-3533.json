So, for example, for a peptide with a monoisotopic mass of 4000 Da, the most intense peak in the isotopic envelope is M+2 \\(that is, 4002 Da), which will most likely be selected as the precursor mass.  If the number of possibilities is set to three, SIM-XL will search this MS/MS spectrum considering the precursor masses 4002, 4001, and 4000, plus or minus the given ppm tolerance.  In this example, the correct monoisotopic precursor mass is 4000 and thus can be correctly identified by SIM-XL.
