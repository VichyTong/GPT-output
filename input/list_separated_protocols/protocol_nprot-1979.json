Precautionary procedures such as swabbing down lab benches with 70% ethanol are advised, as well as the use of nuclease-free water.\r\n\n\n- The use of DNA Lo-Bind tubes \\(Eppendorf) is recommended to reduce loss of sample.\r\n\n\n- A general note for all enzymatic reactions: because excessive glycerol from the enzyme stock may interfere with the reaction, ensure the volume of enzyme is <10% of the final reaction mixture. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe starting material is cells. The chromatin should be isolated from about 10<sup>6</sup> - 10<sup>7</sup> cells such that there will be sufficient chromatin material for library construction and the resulting library will be of high complexity. The cells may be treated with drugs as appropriate \\(Appendix I). The results shown came from a 4C library prepared from estrogen-treated MCF-7 cells."
