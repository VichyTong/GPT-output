Keep the test tubes in a dew chamber to maintain the high humidity required for the fungus to penetrate the cuticle of plants. Following 20-24 hours of incubation in dew chamber, place plants at room temperature for 3 days and assess for pathogenicity. Score blast disease symptoms by visual examination of lesions produced.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n*Rice plants for pathogenicity assay can be prepared as follows. Surface-sterilize plant \\(Rice cv. Nagdongbyeo) seeds with clorox \\(Yuhanrox regularTM) for 20 min, rinse well with distilled water, plant in test tube containing Murashige and Skoog \\(MS) agar medium \\(4.4gL-1and 0.9% agar), and grow for 7-to 8 days until 2 or 3 leaf-stage is reached."
