Stocks that have been maintained in vitro for more than 30 passages may produce more variable results.\r\n\n\n- Culture cells to 40-60% confluence at the point of passaging or experimental use. A density of 1.8x10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> is recommended, but this should be optimised for each cell line.\r\n\n\n- Routinely test all cell lines for Mycoplasma contamination and maintain stocks under antibiotic free conditions to quickly identify microbial infections."
