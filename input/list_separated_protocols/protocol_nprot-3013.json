For the tissues described in Fig. 3a \\(Obokata et al. Nature, 2014a), muscle, adipose tissue and fibroblasts were enzymatically dissociated, whereas others were mechanically dissociated.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n\\(ii) Primary cells should be used. We have found that it is difficult to reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(MEF) that have been expanded in vitro, while fresh MEF are competent.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(iii) For the experiments reported, we used a Oct-3/4-EGFP transgenic mouse line \\(Ohbo et al, Dev Biol, 2003; Yoshimizu et al, Dev Growth Differ, 1999), which is maintained by the RIKEN Bioresource Center as GOF18-GFP line11 transgenic mouse \\(B6;B6D2-Tg\\(GOF18/EGFP)11/Rbrc). Homozygotes of the transgene were used for the live imaging to obtain the enhanced signal.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\(iv) Cells from mice older than one week showed very poor reprogramming efficiency under the current protocol.

After 30 seconds, add 0.2 ml of 10× PBS \\(Gibco 70011-044), followed by 3 ml of 1× PBS \\(Gibco 10010-023), and strain the cell suspension through a cell strainer."

Please adjust pH to 5.7 in cell suspension by the following method. First, suspend the cell pellet with 494 µl of HBSS pre-chilled at 4°C, then add 6 µl of diluted HCl \\(10 µl of 35% HCl in 590 µl of HBSS) to adjust to a final pH of 5.7. Please confirm the final pH in a pilot experiment, and optimize the volume of HCl added, as necessary. Alternatively, suspend the cell pellet in HBSS-pH 5.4 pre-chilled at 4°C.\r\n\n\n\\(ii) The HBSS we used is Ca2+/Mg2+ free \\(Gibco 14170-112).\r\n\n\n\\(iii) Incubate the cells suspended in HBSS in a CO2 incubator.\r\n\n\n\\(iv) Cell viability is a critical parameter in this step. Under optimal conditions, massive cell death is observed at two days after plating, as shown in Figure 1d \\(Obokata et al.

Density should be maintained at 1×105~1×106 cells per cm2 of culture surface. \r\n\n\n\\(iii) B27 \\(Invitrogen 17504-044) may show variation between batches.

Even in the absence of LIF, Oct3/4-GFP+ cells \\(most of which showed dim signals) appeared transiently in low-pH-treated CD45+ cells during days 2–5 of culture, but subsequently disappeared, suggesting that there is a LIF-independent early phase, whereas the subsequent phase is LIF-dependent.\r\n   \r\n\n\nIMPORTANT \r\n\n\n\\(i) Since LIF is essential for the late step of reprogramming, the reprogramming event may depend on the genetic background. We mainly used 129, C57BL6, or their F1 strains, as all of these genetic backgrounds are associated with high responsiveness to LIF.\r\n\n\n\\(ii) The GFP signal is weaker than that of ES cells carrying the same reporter because of the smaller cell volume of STAP cell than ES cell as found in Figure 1g \\(Obokata et al.
