To analyze the area of interest manually, select the “split channel” command via the “image” and “colour” drop-down menu to convert images. Then, use the “freehand selection” tool to enclose the fluorescent area. Select the “measurement” command via the “analyze” drop-down menu to perform pixel intensity analysis. Normalize pixel intensity values to the selected area by using the Microsoft Office 2011 Excel software package \\(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA).Then, calculate GFP to DsRed ratio. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n• Process images collected from \\(B) method with Zeiss ZEN 2011 software to monitor mitochondria engulfed by autophagosomes, known as mitoautophagosomes. To analyze the number of mitoautophagosomes, count manually the co-localization events between mitochondrial \\(mtGFP) and autophagosomal marker \\(LGG-1::DsRed) in each stack of body wall muscle cell.
