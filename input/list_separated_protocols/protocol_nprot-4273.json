Lyophilized neurotrophic factors, although stable at room temperature for 3 weeks, should be stored desiccated below -18°C. Upon reconstitution solutions should be stored at 4°C between 2-7 days and for future use below -18°C. For long term storage it is recommended to add a carrier protein \\(0.1% BSA or HSA in milli-Q H2O filtered in the culture room). Prevent freeze-thaw cycles. The 100µg/ml solution of NF will be further diluted to have a working solution. For example, we usually prepare dilutions \\(1:20) to get a 5µg/ml working solution. Then, 1µl of this solution is added to the matrix \\(0.5ml volume) to obtain a final concentration of NF of 10ng/ml."

Neurite-J is an \"ImageJ\":http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html plug-in that works as an adaption of the Sholl method providing a semi-automatic tool for neurite outgrowth quantification in organotypic cultures. Neurite-J gives a good description of neurite growth providing counts of neurite number and neurite area at different distances from the organotypic explant, as well as some measures of the explant. You can download the plugin and the manual user from \"here\":http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:analysis:neurite-j:start\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMicrophotographs for quantitative analysis are taken using an epifluorescence microscope with a digital camera \\(in our case Olympus BX51 microscope with a DP50 camera). The images are captured with at least a 10X objective to ensure that the resolution is enough to see all the neurites. Usually, the neurite arbor does not fit into a single image, requiring a mosaic of multiple pictures to cover the entire field. The culture images are reconstructed and automatically photomerged using Adobe Photoshop CS4 \\(any software allowing the creation of mosaics should work). Due to the particular features of different microscopes and cameras, we recommend first capturing the images using different settings and running the analysis to define the optimal conditions. Identifying the best options for imaging the cultures is essential to obtain the best performance of Neurite-J plug-in.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nConceptually we divided the analysis process in two steps.",
