        "body": "The fabrication protocol for these MEMS devices is as follows:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\[1] _Cleaning and Growth of Silicon Dioxide Layer_: \r\n\n\nA silicon wafer of 500-550 μm thickness \\(type P, dopant boron, orientation <100>, 100 mm diameter and, resistivity 0-100) was taken and cleaned well with 20 mL of piranha solution \\(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 9:1) for 5 min. It was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove metallic and organic contaminants from the surface and then a 1 μm layer of silicon dioxide was thermally grown over it by nano pyrogenic furnace.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\[2] _Photolithography_:\r\n\n\n\\(a) Dehydration and Spin Coat: A properly cleaned wafer was first dehydrated at 250 ºC for 10 min by keeping it over a hot plate to evaporate all of the surface moisture. Then it was spin coated with AZ5214E, photoresist \\(PR), of nearly 1.5 μm thickness at 6000 rpm for 40 seconds and baked to about 110 ºC for 2 min to evaporate the solvents in PR. \r\n\n\n\\(b) Alignment for pattern transfer: A 3 inch DRIE lithomask was fixed over the treated wafer and kept under UV exposure for 2 sec in EVG 620 double sided mask aligner \\(50 mill joules/cm<sup>2</sup>). The mask was developed by dipping it in the solution of AZ351B:H<sub>2</sub>O in a ratio of 1:4 for 30 sec. It was washed with distilled water, dried under nitrogen and finally heated at 110 ºC for 4 min to get the pattern for the expected microstructures. The developed cantilevers and fixed-fixed beams were observed under the optical microscope. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\\[3] _Dry Etch to release the pattern_:\r\n\n\nFirst formalin oil was put on a large carrier wafer to prepare sticky base for the sample. The sample was loaded inside the reactive ion etching chlorine \\(RIE-Cl) chamber and followed by the three steps.\r\n\n\n\\(a) Anisotropic plasma etch of silicon: First silicon dioxide \\(SiO<sub>2</sub>) was plasma etched with 5 torr of pressure and 50 power for 6 min. \r\n\n\n\\(b) Isotropic Si etch: Secondly silicon was etched with 7.5 torr of pressure and 30 power for 3 min and \r\n\n\n\\(c) Oxygen etch: Lastly photoresist was removed by oxygen etching with 0 torr pressure and 150 power for 4 min. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe completely released devices were carefully diced from the wafer and proceeded for the functionalization steps. Four different cantilevers and fixed-fixed beams each of which distinguishable from the other based upon its length were fabricated. The cantilevers had the lengths of 86.6, 36.5, 28.1 and 19.8 μm respectively and the fixed-fixed beams had the lengths of 53.4, 35.5, 27.1 and 21.3 μm respectively. The cantilevers had the uniform width of 5.08 μm, whereas the fixed-fixed beams had uniform width of 4.74 μm. Each of the structure had a uniform thickness of 1.04 μm."

We had chosen B-doped silicon dioxide surface having free hydroxyl groups. \r\n\n\nAt first we have cleaned the surfaces of the silicon dioxide based substrates by dipping in 20 mL of piranha solution \\(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 9:1) for 5 min to remove the organic and metallic contaminants. The temperature of the solution is maintained at 85 ºC and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added carefully to replenish the temperature. These cleaned devices were undertaken for the further functionalization steps to create at least one anchor site with one or multiple amine groups.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProtocol 1:\r\n\n\n_Step 1_: The hydroxyl groups on the cleaned surface of substrates were functionalized with 4% of 3-aminopropyl triethoxy silane \\(3-APTES) in 10 mL of toluene under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at room temperature for 2 h. After the reaction time is over, the surfaces were rinsed with distilled water repeatedly and finally dried under nitrogen flow.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProtocol 2:\r\n\n\n_Step 1_: The hydroxyl groups on the cleaned surface of substrates were functionalized with 10% of 3-mercaptopropyl triethoxy silane \\(3-MPTES) in 10 mL of toluene under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at room temperature for 4 h. Then the surfaces were rinsed with fresh toluene repeatedly and finally dried under nitrogen flow. The surfaces were reacted immediately as described in the next step or it was kept under xylene to protect the surfaces from aerial oxidation.\r\n\n\n_Step 2_: The free thiol groups on the surfaces were reacted with a crosslinker, 3-\\(maleimido)-propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester in 10 mL of dimethylformamide \\(DMF) for 5 h and then rinsed properly with water and ethanol. Again the surfaces were dried under nitrogen flow before proceeding for the next step.\r\n\n\n_Step 3_: The surface immobilized N-hydroxysuccinimido group was further reacted with an amino functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane \\(POSS-NH<sub>2</sub>)<sup>16</sup> moiety in 12 mL of DMF:H<sub>2</sub>O = 3:1 mixture. Ten equivalents of triethylmine \\(Et<sub>3</sub>N) and 0.1 equivalent of dimethylaminopyridine \\(DMAP) with respect to POSS-NH<sub>2</sub> were also added to the same mixture and kept for overnight.

Acquisition was done by a focussed 30KV Ga ion source in the LMIG gun which was rastered in 300 × 300 μm area to induce the desorption and ionization of atomic and molecular species from the functionalized surfaces with the beam current typically around 7 nA. The resulting secondary ions were accelerated into the mass spectrometer where they were mass separated by measuring the time-of-flight from the sample to the detector and a mass spectrum was recorded. Surface spectra were acquired in positive ion mode with a mass range of 0-1500 amu on 3-5 sections, for 5 min each, on two samples per set.
