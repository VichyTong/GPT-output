To identify possible contributions of cell size to filtration of different samples, retention data can be plotted as a function of cell-to-pore size ratio \\(Figure 5d).  For example, a strong, positive correlation between retention and cell-to-pore size may indicate that filtration is influenced by differences in cell size among samples, rather than cell deformability. In this case, complementary mechanotyping methods should be additional used that are independent of cell size, such as atomic force microscopy."

To achieve the maximal dynamic range of % retention for the cell types to be compared, both pressure and time should be optimized prior to deformability measurements.  First, test an applied pressure of 2.1 kPa for 30 s on the control sample. Based on the % retention for this set of test conditions, adjust the pressure and time duration to achieve approximately 50 % retention for the control sample; this allows for a maximum range so that the lowest and highest retention samples can be resolved. When testing samples that are expected to have a higher retention than the control, adjust the applied pressure and time duration to achieve a baseline of approximately 20 % retention; by contrast, a baseline of 80 % retention for the control sample enables samples with reduced retention to be optimally resolved \\(Figure",
