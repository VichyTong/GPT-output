Using a 1 mL pipette tip with the end cut off, add 200 µL curing agent to the PDMS in each well and mix thoroughly by swirling with a 1 mL pipette tip.  2 mL total of PDMS reagents in the well will result in a 3 mm thick, 1.72 MPa stiffness PDMS layer after curing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOPTIONAL STEP: Place 6-well plate with PDMS into a vacuum desiccator for ~1 hr to remove air bubbles.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP: Place PDMS in a 37°C incubator for ≥12 hr to allow for complete curing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING: If using single 35 mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes, you will have to experiment with the volumes needed \\(being careful to keep the ratio of PDMS to curing agent constant) to achieve a similar thickness of PDMS as described above for a 6-well plate.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep"
