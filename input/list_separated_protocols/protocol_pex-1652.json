    "\n<p><strong>General Considerations:</strong></p><p>Steps 1-5 are specific to the extraction of DNA from skeletal human remains. When applying this protocol to other source materials like forensic trace samples, steps 1-5 should be replaced by sample-specific preparation steps as featured in e.g. Wash et al (1991) <sup>13</sup>.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Optimized Protocol:</strong></p><p><strong>I. Sample Preparation</strong></p><p>1. When investigating ancient human skeletons, the sampling of long bones – preferably the mid shaft region – is recommendable. Because of their compactness, these skeletal elements show a relatively high probability of successful DNA recovery compared to less dense parts of the skeleton. A sample of 1x1cm (ca.",

To prevent co-processing of possible adhering contaminations, exposed surfaces of the bone sample are quantitatively removed by the use of a sterile scalpel. Subsequently the material is exposed to UV light for 15min each of the previous surfaces (periosteum and medullary cavity).</p><p>3. Samples are ground to a fine powder using a mixer mill (MM2000, Retsch) or an agate mortar and pestle, according to the consistency of the material.</p><p>4. 0.3g bone powder is mixed with 1,5ml EDTA-solution (0.5M, pH 8.3) in a 2ml reaction tube, vortexed vigorously (e.g. Vortex Genie 2, VWRbrand), and incubated at constant rotation or agitation respectively for 48h at a constant temperature of 20˚C (incubator or shaking water bath). Depending on the degree of DNA degradation respectively state of DNA preservation to be expected in the material at hand, the parameters of this step can be adapted to the following to optimize DNA yield of the extracts (cf. <sup>2, 5</sup> and Tab. 1).</p><p>5. The remaining bone powder is pelleted by centrifugation for 5min at 6000rpm (desktop centrifuge 5415C, Eppendorf).</p><p> </p><p><strong>II. Chelex 100-based DNA extraction</strong></p><p>6. The supernatant (ca. 1300µl) is transferred to a 5ml tube (Polypropylene round-bottom tube, Falcon).</p><p>7. 1300µl Chelex-100-solution (5% in sterile Water, e.g. Ampuwa<sup>®</sup>, Fresenius or 18 Megohm Water, Sigma) and 500µl proteinase K-solution (20mg/ml, e.g. Qiagen) are added.</p><p>8. The mixture is vortexed briefly (5-10sec, Vortex Genie 2, VWRbrand) and incubated at 56˚C and constant shaking at 300rpm (Thermomixer, Eppendorf) for a duration appropriate for the DNA degradation expected in the material to be analyzed (cf. <sup>2, 5</sup> and Tab. 2).</p><p>9. The mix is vortexed again briefly (5-10sec) and incubated at 95˚C for 8min (Thermomixer, Eppendorf) to denature and deactivate the proteinase.</p><p>10. The mixture is left to cool down slowly to room temperature (Thermomixer, Eppendorf) and the aqueous portion is separated from the Chelex resin by centrifugation for 6min at 4000rpm (Centrifuge 5804, Eppendorf).</p><p> </p><p><strong>III.

To ensure optimal stability of the extracted DNA, storage of the extract with silica at -20˚C is recommended <sup>36</sup>.</p>"
