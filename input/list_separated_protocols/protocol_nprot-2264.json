        "body": "1│ Harvest cells growing in monolayer in T-75 ml cell culture flasks. Add 5.0 ml of trypsin-EDTA to each plate and incubate at room temperature for 4 min. Add 5.0 ml of RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES cell culture medium and transfer cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube.\r\n\n\n2│ Pellet suspended cells in 15 ml conical tubes using a centrifuge for 5 min at 500g. Re-suspend each cell pellet in 2-3 ml of media and perform cell counts.\r\n\n\n3│ Place a coverslip inside culture plates \\(6 well-plate) with sterilized tweezers. \r\n\n\nCRITICAL STEP. It is very important that all coverslips used for growing cells must be carefully handled to avoid contamination. Caution should also be taken when place the growing side \\(usually only one side is treated for cell attachment) of the coverslip correctly.\r\n\n\n4│ Complete media is then added to culture plates \\(2 ml) without dropping media over the coverslips to ensure that cells keep attached to the surface. \r\n\n\n5│ Cells are seeded at the appropriate final density \\(50,000 cells/ml but may vary depending on cell type/size). After adding cells, plates are slowly shaken to homogenize cell distribution."

Three of the wells are used for washing \\(PBS-glucose) while the other can be used employed for staining. \r\n\n\n8│ Add 20 µl of AO solution to RPMI medium of three plates and shake to homogenize.\r\n\n\n9│ Using sterilized tweezers place each one of the coverslips containing cells in one of the wells with washing solution for 1 minute and then take coverslips into wells for staining during 10 minutes at RT.\r\n\n\n10│ After this time pipet 100 µl of RPMI medium with 0.2% FBS on a clean slide and then place coverslips with cells over medium upside-down. Then mounting medium is used as adhesive, using it only in the external limits of coverslip to avoid auto-fluorescence.\r\n\n\n11│ Immediately after mounting place slide with one drop of immersion oil under the confocal microscopy."

You must move the threshold line up in order to eliminate those objects that correspond to incomplete cells with too low volumes or “cut-off” cells on both sides of image selected. Then click again on the blue button to finish these steps.\r\n\n\n23│ Select tab labeled as ‘pencil’ and click on ‘select’ for selecting all those incomplete cells that were impossible to eliminate in the previous step. For eliminating those cells just select them and then ‘delete’."

        "body": "24│ When working with specific cell types, many of them grow either in clusters or they form groups in which many of the cells remain bound one to each other. When this happens, it is necessary to cut between two or more cells. However it is quite easy to identify the binding area because usually it appears as a “valley” just between adjacent cells thus indicating the joining point. Consequently user has to choose these points and make the appropriate cuttings for obtaining accurate measurements."

Just click on any of the data displayed and then the corresponding cell image will appear, so user can easily correlate any of the data with the cellular source.\r\n\n\n26│ Data can be easily exported to an excel datasheet by selecting in the same tab the ‘save’ command.

This would allow users to compare and correlate data with cells using other programs with a more intuitive interface."
