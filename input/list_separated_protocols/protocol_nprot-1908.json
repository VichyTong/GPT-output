The activities of these proteins are stimulated by either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or HOP2/MND1 heterodimer 8-11. Rad54 and BLM proteins are required for dissociation of D-loops through their DNA branch migration activities 9,12. While Ca2+ stimulates D-loop formation by RAD51 or DMC1, it inhibits D-loop dissociation catalyzed by Rad54 or BLM. Therefore, prior to the D-loops disruption step, Ca<sup>2+</sup> has to be depleted from the reaction mixture by adding an equimolar amount of EGTA. The synaptic complex protection assay <sup>13,14</sup> are used as an independent approach to confirm the greater resistance of DMC1 nucleoprotein complexes to dissociation by RAD54. In addition, the chemical footprinting with potassium permanganate are used to evaluate the length of DMC1 and RAD51 nucleoproteins complexes and to reveal differences in the structure of these complexes."

To ensure that footprinting is performed under exactly the same conditions, dialyze RAD51 and DMC1 against the same batch of dialysis buffer \\(35 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 200 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT). Use the same buffer to dilute both proteins to the same concentration prior to complex formation and add the same volume of dialysis buffer to the reaction mixture in the mock “no protein” experiments."
