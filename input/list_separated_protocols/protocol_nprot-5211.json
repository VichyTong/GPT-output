That means that, given the definition of the linker used, TopoLink will search for consistent topological distances for every pair of residues that could, by the chemical nature of the linker and the residues involved, be attached by the linker. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFinally, compute reactive tells TopoLink to consider that only residues that were experimentally observed to react \\(by participating in observed crosslinks or dead-ends) are reactive. Then, TopoLink will search for topological distances consistent with the linker used only between these pairs of \"observed-reactive\" residues. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAdditionally, the user may optionally choose to compute only the crosslinks between different chains of the PDB file, for instance to compute inter-proteins crosslinks in a complex.
