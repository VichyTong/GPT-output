    "\nSELECTION OF GENE OR SEQUENCE FOR ANALYSIS\r\n\n\n• to avoid excess signals from hybridized probes, there should be no more than 2 alleles of the gene to be analyzed, and ideally there should be no pseudogenes\r\n\n\n• the gene or sequence should not contain matrix attachment sites, which might impede migration during electrophoresis; in most cases this must be determined in pilot experiments.\r\n\n\n• the gene should be expressed throughout the cell cycle, to ensure that the template strand is actively transcribed in each cell\r\n\n\n• the ‘non-transcribed’ strand of the gene should not also serve as a template for transcription\r\n\n\n• the size of the sequence should be about 100-300 kb to ensure that a significant percentage of the DNA strands can be damaged with very low doses of DNA damaging agents. We have found that treatments that result in lesions in 20-30% of the strands permit measurable levels of damage, while minimizing instances of more than 1 lesion per strand; 1-10 lesions per 10<sup>6</sup> nucleotides fall within the limits of resolution for the comet assay.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSYNTHESIS OF PROBES BY PCR \r\n\n\nThe procedure for probe preparation is shown in figure",

Each probe is synthesized in a separate PCR, then purified and verified before labelling with fluorophores. Approximately 50 fluorescent probes are required to obtain a detectable signal, thus 50 independent PCR syntheses must be carried out to generate probes for each DNA strand target.\r\n\n\nImportant: designate a separated work area and use reagents, pipets, tips, etc. exclusively for PCR"
