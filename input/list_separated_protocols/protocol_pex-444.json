All of them will be displayed sorted by <em>CombScore</em>. On the top will be displayed the full protein sequence and all theoretical modifications (present in the database) as can be seen in <strong>Figure 4</strong>. All theoretical chains will be shown below protein sequence in gray dash lines. The user is able to check all information about the modification or theoretical chain by passing the mouse over the line or the modified amino acid. (<strong>Figure 4</strong>)</p><p><strong>3.5.3.1.</strong> Each proteoform will be displayed according to the classification: expected, non-expected or tagged proteoform. By right-clicking on each line, the user is able to assess the proteoform identification (valid or invalid); in addition, it’s possible to highlight only the peptides that fit into the proteoform. (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). By hovering over each line, some information will be shown: Proteoform sequence, Score, Search engine that identified this specific sequence, Start and End positions.</p><p><strong>3.5.3.2.</strong> All identified PTMs will also be displayed and by hovering over each one, it is possible to check their position and description.</p><p><strong>[Figure 5]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>3.5.3.3.</strong> The identified proteoforms and/or peptides can be displayed in a single line or in multiple lines.

This can be accomplished in three ways, the easiest one is by double-clicking on a ProteoCombiner results file. If the <em>Results Browser</em> window is opened, another way to launch the file is by clicking on <em>Load </em>option from the <em>File</em> menu or by pressing CTRL + O, as seen in (<strong>Figure 6</strong>). Otherwise, if the main window is opened, select <em>Load Results</em> from <em>File</em> menu (or press CTRL + O), as seen in <strong>Figure 7</strong>.</p><p><strong>[Figure 6]</strong></p><p><strong>[Figure 7]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>3.7.</strong> <strong><em>Exporting results</em></strong></p><p><strong>3.7.1.</strong> <strong><em>ProteoCombiner</em></strong> also allows to export all combined results to Excel® (<em>*.xlsx</em>) or PDF® file. This is done by selecting <em>Excel file</em> from the File menu Þ Export results (or by pressing ALT + E). Or by selecting <em>PDF file</em> from the File menu Þ Export results (or by pressing ALT + P). (<strong>Figure 6</strong>)</p>"
