Search parameters include trypsin specificity with two missed cleavages. The variable modifications of oxidized methionine, pyroglutamic acid for N-terminal glutamine, N-terminal acetylation of the protein, biotin-phenol on tyrosine and a fixed modification for carbamidomethyl cysteine are considered.  For SILAC labels, the medium samples are labeled with Lys4 and Arg6 and the heavy samples are labeled with Lys8 and Arg10. The mass tolerances are 10 ppm for the precursor and 0.05 Da for the fragments. SILAC ratio quantitation is accomplished using Mascot Distiller and the results from Mascot Distiller are loaded into the Scaffold Viewer for peptide/protein validation and SILAC label quantitation. For SILAC experiments, protein identification is subject to a two-peptide cut-off. For proteins detectable in the H sample but that lack an empirical H/L ratio value \\(due to low background detection in the L sample), peak areas of all the identified peptides in the Distiller file are used to calculate H/L ratios. \r\n  \\[optional approach: workflow of label-free quantification \\(LFQ) proteomic approach is similar]."
