    "\n<p>General information</p><p>Before proceeding with DECRO system setup, check the environment and housing conditions of your rats for any potential stressor (2) (25) (26). Check for any clinical signs, observe rats’ behaviour in housing cages and assess welfare level. During the acclimatization period, handle your rat as much as necessary until you both feel comfortable together. This helps reducing stress levels during experiment day.</p><p>In line with the aim of stress reduction on experiment day, we recommend two training sessions (one per day) the week before (in the same conditions of the study) of at least two hours with the jacket. This also allows the experimenter to identify rats who may cause potential problems during recording and to take precautions for experiment day (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>).</p><p>Equipment such as the jacket, ECG electrodes, rechargeable battery and Bluetooth emitter are reusable. Using their ID number, each rat can have its own equipment throughout the study, starting from training session.</p><p>Hair removal:&nbsp;Timing <strong>1-2 minutes</strong> per animal</p><p>1 Hold the rat firmly and carefully clip the hair at the dorsolateral thoracic and abdominal area (<strong>Fig. 4A</strong>), using corded-electric or battery-operated clippers. Clean clipped area with water to remove sebum produced by rat skin and make sure the area is completely dry. Dry it with wiper if necessary. This step can be done either on experiment day or the day before. We recommend it to be done on the day before to reduce stress level on experiment day.</p><p>CRITICAL STEP: The rat skin produces sebum which may neutralize the adhesive of the ECG electrodes. Therefore, be sure that clipped area is cleaned with water and dried.&nbsp;</p><p>DECRO system <strong><em>in-vivo </em></strong>setup: Timing <strong>3-5 minutes</strong> per animal</p><p>The following “Step 1” is a preparation for steps 4 and 5 to fit the rat with the jacket. We recommend using the jacket fitting-tool in step",

            "However, its use is not mandatory. Experienced experimenters may have their own procedure or feel comfortable to proceed in a different way. Although we recommend using the jacket fitting-tool, the decision is left to self-appreciation based on skill level to handle rats.</p><p>1 Place the soft, stretch and fitted jacket on the jacket fitting-tool (<strong>Fig. 4B</strong>). Two ways are described below:</p><p>A. Place the jacket fitting-tool on its large circular base. Use one hand to hold the jacket fitting-tool and to tighten it up and the other hand to place the jacket around its top by rotating movements. Push the jacket to the bottom and leave approximately 2 cm extended at the top.</p><p>B. Place the jacket fitting-tool on its large circular base. Use both hands to stretch and enlarge the jacket and place it on the jacket fitting-tool. Adjust the length extending at the top to approximately 2 cm.</p><p>CAUTION: While placing the jacket on the jacket fitting-tool, check the plethysmographic sensors position inside the jacket in order to avoid damaging them with the jacket fitting-tool borders. In addition, the jacket bag should be positioned on the jacket fitting-tool upper side so it can be correctly placed on the rat's back in step 5.</p><p>2 Insert the rechargeable battery in the Bluetooth emitter, check that the emitter light blinks several times to confirm that the system is powered and prepare the electrodes by adding a very small pinch of conductive gel on their adhesive surface.</p><p>3 Hold the rat and apply gently with your finger, a small amount of conductive gel on the whole clipped area in order to enhance ECG electrode conductivity.</p><p>4 Place the jacket fitting-tool on its side using its rectangular base and place the rat very closely with his head directed toward its large opening.</p><p>5 Guide the rat to enter in the jacket-fitting tool (<strong>Fig. 4C</strong>). As soon as the head penetrates from the other side and you see his forelimbs, use one hand to hold the rat and the jacket together, and with the other hand release the remaining jacket from the jacket-fitting tool by pushing it toward the rat exit direction.</p><p>CRITICAL STEP: Motivate the rat to go through the jacket-fitting tool by placing a red enrichment tunnel at the other side or by placing the rat with the jacket-fitting tool at the edge of its housing cage (<strong>Fig. 4C-D</strong>). </p><p>CAUTION: Choose the jacket size that best fits to your rat body weight (Fig.",

                "body": "We recommend using the same jacket per animal per study (several days to several weeks) as long as the size is adapted. Note that in long term studies (several weeks to several months), you may need to use more than one jacket per rat based on body weight range (Fig. 5).</p><p>6 Use one hand to hold the rat with its jacket, and with the other hand pass each paw in the jacket’s holes to secure the jacket onto the rat.</p><p>7 Check that rat’s skin is smoothly placed under the jacket without any fold. This will help to keep ECG electrodes firmly connected on the skin.  </p><p>8 Put the rat in a prone position and insert red ECG electrode (positive) under the jacket through left side jacket notch and the black one (negative) through the right side (Lead I configuration ECG). Press down gently on the electrodes to completely adhere on the flank skin (<strong>Fig. 4E-F</strong>).</p><p>9 Connect the plethysmographic sensors and the ECG electrodes cables to the Bluetooth emitter, which is already connected to its rechargeable battery (from step 3).</p><p>10 Fold the posterior part of the jacket on the notches/cables to hide them (<strong>Fig. 4G</strong>).</p><p>11 Insert the Bluetooth emitter and its rechargeable battery into the anterior bag with the Bluetooth emitter facing the rat head and place the bag on the rat back to attach it with the hook (<strong>Fig. 4H</strong>).</p><p>12 The rat is ready for recording (<strong>Fig. 4H-J</strong>). Before putting him in its cage, check the quality of the signals by starting acquisition while he is still at rest.</p><p>CAUTION: ECG electrodes can be used multiple time on the same rat and on several days if kept properly in their bags. If the ECG signal is not satisfactory at rest, check the adherence of ECG electrodes and the skin folding under the jacket. If you apply again conductive gel between the ECG electrode and the clipped area, wait few minutes to observe a good quality signal. If the ECG signal is not satisfactory despite the above checking steps, use new set of electrodes.</p><p>DECRO system <strong>hardware </strong>setup: Timing <strong>4-10 minutes</strong> per experiment based on protocol complexity</p><p>NOTE: Hardware setup and protocol configuration can be done on any day prior to the recording day. If required, the software allows to schedule the acquisitions in a repeated way for several sessions.</p><p>1 Place the acquisition server in the same room of recording (up to 10 meters). Note that it is recommended to avoid placement of the system into any metallic frame that may act as a faraday cage and thus reduce Bluetooth performances.</p><p>2 Connect the two antennas at the back end and plug in the electrical cable. The acquisition server may turn on automatically, if not press the on/off button. Wait until the red light turns off at the front end which usually takes 60 to 90 seconds</p><p>3 Connect the acquisition server to your computer either by direct connection with an ethernet cable or by a local area network for remote access (i.e from office)</p><p>4 Open a web browser (firefox or chrome recommended) on your computer and enter the URL delivered with the acquisition server in the address bar to access to the built-in acquisition software</p><p>5 Configure the experiment protocol by entering group, phase and session details and parameters needed such as respiratory rate, ECG, etc.</p><p>6 Complete step 1 from hair removal and steps 1 to 12 from “DECRO system <em>in-vivo</em> setup” and start your acquisition session.</p><p>DECRO system <strong>jacket removal</strong>: Timing <strong>1 minute</strong> per animal</p><p>1 Put the rat in a prone position, hold him gently and detach the bag hook from the jacket.</p><p>2 Remove the Bluetooth emitter and rechargeable battery from its bag and disconnect ECG and plethysmography cables.</p><p>3 Unfold the posterior part of the jacket to have access to the ECG electrode notch sites</p><p>4 Remove the ECG electrodes gently and the paws from the jacket’s holes.</p><p>5 To take off the jacket, allow the rat to move forward while you hold the jacket with both hands. Avoid taking off the jacket by going counter-direction to hair growth since this could be uncomfortable or stressful for the rat.</p><p>6 Disconnect the battery from the Bluetooth emitter and put the battery in charge with the charger provided with the system. A full charge of the battery usually takes less than 3 hours.</p>"
