For the sample file 1CRN.pdb with the parameters explained above a typical HORI output consists of 3 links for browsing and 3 links for file download. An example output file is available at this URL with the parameters explained above from this  \"URL\":http://caps.ncbs.res.in/hori/hori_results/er_hori_SatDec13185917IST2008.html. Details of the input file and parameters used for the HORI submission are presented in the beginning of the result page. A typical HORI-Global output page follows that is divided in to three sections as HORI - Pairwise Interactions, HORI - Triplet Interactions and HORI - Quadruple Interactions. Each of these sections provides links for browsing the results and visualizes the individual higher order interactions using RasMol or Jmol. The second link can be used to download higher order interaction data in a text format for parsing or further distance calculations and analysis. In the given example link, if user click on the \"Show Pairwise - Interactions\" link, the section will expand and results will be displayed in a tabular format. At the same time \"Show Pairwise - Interactions\" link will replaced with the \"Hide Pairwise - Interactions\" link. This link can be used to hide this list. If you click on the \"Show Pairwise - Interactions\" it shows a detailed table with No., Residue No., Interacting Residues, Distance, and links to download a copy of RasMol script file for visualization of individual interactions in client machine and visualization in client browser using Jmol. Here the first \"No\" column indicates the serial number of interaction. This can be used as a parameter when user wanted to compare total number of different interactions across different members from same protein family. This is followed by \"Residue No\" column which provides number of residues involved in a particular interaction. Third column is giving details about the \"Interacting Residues\" in terms of three-letter amino acid code. Fourth column provides \"Distance\" in terms of Angstroms. Fifth column provides an image of RasMol logo that provides link to download the RasMol script file. For visualization using RasMol<sup>20, 21</sup>, user should install RasMol. A RasMol script file can be visualized using command line interface of RasMol. The coordinates of query protein highlighted by HORI can be downloaded and conveniently displayed with standard macromolecule structural visualization software such as RasMol.  In order to view a HORI RasMol script file,  Please follow the steps: \r\n  \r\n\n\n_a. Click the link \"Rasmol view\"_\r\n\n\n_b. Save the text file. In this example, the file name will be \"hori_rasmol_doublet.cgi\"_ \r\n\n\n_c. Use \"rasmol -script hori_rasmol_doublet.cgi\" command_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSixth column consists of an image of Jmol logo provides a link to access the dynamic Jmol interface to visualize the interactions in the browser. If user would like to visualize a particular interaction within the browser, based on Java compatibility of the browser, user can visualize a particular interaction within the browser using Jmol<sup>22</sup>. The number of the three columns \"Residue No.\", \"Interacting Residues\" and \"Distance\" in the result page varies between different higher order interactions. For example in pairwise interactions, there is one set of these 3 columns, but in case of triplet interactions these columns are repeated three times to describe a pairwise interaction and for quadruple interaction this columns are repeated 6 times to describe the details of residues involved in a particular quadruple interactions. A screen shot collage with details about different sections of output is provided in Figure 3."
