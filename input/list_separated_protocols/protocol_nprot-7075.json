No incision is made on the basal \\(abaxial) petiole surface. A second similar incision is made up to 4 mm from the first incision in the direction of the leaf tip. Then, perpendicular to the first incisions, a third cut through the adaxial \\(upper) epidermis is made to join the first incisions. In all cases, care is taken not to damage the vasculature. Then, using small forceps and a scalpel, extravascular tissues are gently removed from the region of the incisions. This leaves an exposed region of vein. These manipulations are summarized in"
