Microarrays are carefully removed from the falcon tubes by using forceps with tips surrounded by rubber."

Software programmes such as GenePix Pro can be used to automatically identify the spotted features and convert fluorescence signals into intensity values. Local background should be substracted for each feature and data should be normalized. Signal intensities from the spike-in controls are used to determine the background level of each array as well as the minimum level of regulation."
