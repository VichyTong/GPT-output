This plasmid should then be transformed into a SWAT donor strain, which already contains the SGA procedure genetic traits, and is compatible with the SWAT method as it harbors a galactose induced I-SceI. Once introduced with the donor plasmid the donor strain is crossed with the SWAT library, and the following steps of the SGA process are performed: mating, diploid selection, sporulation, haploid selection and double-mutant selection. At this point, swapping of the desired module into the genome is induced by replicating the double mutant plates onto galactose containing media. Finally, selection for positively swapped yeast is performed by 5-FOA \\(negative selection for the SWAT acceptor module), and/or by a selection marker introduced with the donor module.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6491/original/Figure_1_Composition_of_the_SWAT_full_genome_library.jpg?1520239592\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6491/thumbnail/Figure_1_Composition_of_the_SWAT_full_genome_library.png?1520239592\" > </a>\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6493/original/Figure_2_Swapping_types.png?1520239673\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6493/thumbnail/Figure_2_Swapping_types.png?1520239673\" > </a>"

Therefore, non-seamless swapping donor plasmids should contain another version of these features as well \\(such as a different signal peptide), and introduced separately to assemble a donor strain to be crossed with this subset of strains of the SWAT library.\r\n\n\nTo ease the cloning of donor plasmids, several template plasmids were prepared by us and are freely available. These plasmids contain all the features above, and should only be modified by insertion of the desired genomic modification to be introduced instead of the SWAT tag in the library. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe plasmids do not contain multiple cloning sites and therefore we highly recommend using either restriction free \\(RF) cloning \\(Unger et al., 2010) or Gibson assembly \\(Gibson et al., 2009) to perform plasmid cloning steps, and to sequence the entirety of the swap module \\(sequence between and including both SceI sites) before testing the cloned constructs."
