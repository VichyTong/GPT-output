After chemicals are added to plates in hoods and solutions are evenly dispersed across plates, they are allowed to dry in the hood. Immediately after drying, stack plates with lids on top and allow plates to sit in incubators \\(20°C and 80% humidity) for 24 hours to allow for chemical diffusion after which they can be stored at 4°C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\nCITP Compound Preparation Instructions\r\n\n\nAlpha-Lipoic Acid\r\n\n\nIntervention source \r\n\n\nCompany:  Sigma, T1395-1g\r\n\n\nLot #:  SLBJ6083V\r\n\n\nContainer opening date:  \r\n\n\nSolubility: Soluble in DMSO MW: 206.33 g/mol\r\n\n\nStock concentration: 40 mM\r\n\n\nFinal concentration: 100 µM\r\n\n\nStock preparation and handling:\r\n\n\nTo prepare 5 mL of stock solution in DMSO at room temperature: Add 41.27 mg powder to 5 mL DMSO.\r\n\n\nFilter sterilization required?
