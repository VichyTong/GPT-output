    "\nThe procedure is divided in three sections \\(I. Cultivation / Sampling; II. Sample preparation for the determination of cellular DMSOP; III. Chromatography and mass spectrometry). Details for each section are described below. Note: The protocol generates samples that allow the determination of other low molecular weight zwitterionic metabolites like DMSP, glycine betaine or gonyol. For these and other zwitterionic metabolites the protocol can be followed with only one adjustment: appropriate standards of the analytes of interest would have to be used instead of the DMSOP standard. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nI. Cultivation / Sampling\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nUtilize any culture of microalgae or field sample of phytoplankton. The amount of culture / field sample depends on the cell count, cell volume, and the content of DMSOP or of other zwitterionic low molecular weight metabolites of the tested alga. Further, the sensitivity of the LC/MS equipment has to be taken into consideration. The protocol introduced below has been optimized for 100 – 200 mL exponential phase cultures or 20 – 50 mL stationary phase cultures of diatoms \\(here _Skeletonema costatum_) or 100 µL of dense bacterial cultures \\(here _Pelagibacter bermudensis_) and measurement on an Orbitrap Q-Exactive LC/MS instrument. The protocol can be readily scaled up and down.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nII. Sample preparation for the determination of cellular DMSOP\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMake sure you have ready the equipment and solutions before the start of the procedure. Label the vials before the start of the experiment. The workflow should be carried out without interruption if quantitative information is required. If required, the protocol could only be paused after point",
