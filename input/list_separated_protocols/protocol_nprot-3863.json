During housing the gut microbiota can drift or shift due to primarily contaminated \\(partly irradiated) food or environmental contamination.  Be aware that commercial irradiated rodent diets are not sterile, and therefore a common source for flora divergence. The goal of this protocol is to homogenize/expose all animals to a pool of mouse fecal microbiota \\(flora) created by combining fresh feces from all mice and 7-day old bedding flora from all cages from which experimental mice derive. The following set up of mice can be done to determine changes in the 16S flora in animals have diverse genotypes or if they originate from different colonies. In our laboratory, we also do fecal homogenization \\(IsPreFeH) 5-7 days prior to the start of DSS-experiments."

Immediately read plate at A450 absorbance. We determined there is no difference in loading times and number of steps if MPO assays were to be performed with a 12-channel pipette and loading the samples as columns. However, because it is easy to monitor that 8-chanels work properly during pipetting in a time sensitive assay, we designed our MPO assay and excel templates to calculate the MPO more efficiently. We also determined it is not worth loading 32 samples per plate because the first samples will be sitting on the ELISA plate too long. MPO activity starts within seconds at room temperature, and most centrifuges and homogenizer handle 24 sample batches. That is critical if high activity is expected, and not so much with lower activity. See in"
