The organic phase was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvents were evaporated, leaving the target compound as a yellow solid.

The mixture solution was then stirred for 4-5 hours at 80°C, cooled to room temperature and combined with 60 ml of water, after which it was continually stirred at ambient temperature. The insoluble precipitate was filtered and dissolved in ether, and this solution was washed 2-3 times with saturated sodium chloride solution and water to remove any unreacted residues. Removing the solvent yielded a yellow powder, which was dried in a vacuum for 24 hours at 50 °C \\(yield: 1.91 g, 80.2%)."
