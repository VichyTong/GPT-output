    "\nThe protocol leverages the organization of MFSs in equistructural groups \\(EGs hereafter) that is already provided by the MetalPDB database \\(http://metalweb.cerm.unifi.it/). Such groups contain the MFSs that are found in proteins with the same fold and occur at the same position within that fold. EG are computed in MetalPDB by superimposing the entire domain containing the MFS in the protein structures under consideration and then computing the distance between the metal centers. MFSs whose metal centers are within a threshold of 3.5 Ã… from one another are assigned to the same equistructural group.\r\n\n\nThe workflow consisnts of the following steps:",
