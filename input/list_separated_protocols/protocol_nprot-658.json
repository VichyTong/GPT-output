"\nPreparation of reagent 2\\[7] \r\n\n\n1] Add 40 mL diethyl ether to a 250 mL round bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar.\r\n\n\n2] Add 0.05 mL pyridine to the flask.\r\n\n\n3] Add 3.8 mL bromoacetyl bromide 4 to the flask, close the flask with a glass stopper.\r\n\n\n4] Put the flask on the ice-bath and turn on stirring. \r\n\n\n5] Make a solution of 16 mL of diethyl ether, 2.9 mL of allyl alcohol \\(3) and 6.4 mL of triethyl amine.\r\n\n\n6] Equip the flask with a dropping funnel and add the mixture from 5] dropwise to the cooled solution of bromoacetyl bromide. \r\n\n\n6] Stir for 30 min.\r\n\n\n7] Add an additional 20 mL of diethyl ether to the flask.\r\n\n\n8] Stir for an additional 3 h.\r\n\n\n9] Filter off the precipitate on a glass filter funnel.\r\n\n\n10] Evaporate the filtrate under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and purify further using vacuum distillation \\(Bp = 80 ËšC at 15mm Hg).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSynthesis of alkyne and azide functionalized nucleosides 5 and 6\r\n\n\n1] Add 269 mg of compound 1 to a 100 mL round bottomed flask\r\n\n\n2] Add 10 mL THF, and evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, repeat the procedure. \r\n\n\n3] Add a magnetic stirrer bar and leave the compound for drying under vacuum for 30 min.\r\n\n\n4] Add 20 mL THF to the flask, close the flask with a glass tube \\(containing a stopcock) equipped with a balloon containing Ar \\(g), open the stopcock to flush the compound with argon.\r\n\n\n5] Add 73 mg of potassium t-butoxide while stirring, continue stirring for 30 min.\r\n\n\n6] Add 116 mg of allyl bromoacetate \\(2) and continue stirring for an additional 2 h.\r\n\n\n7] Remove the solvent by evaporation under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. \r\n\n\n8] Dissolve the residue in 10 mL dry methanol and add 275 mg of propargyl amine \\(10eq), or alternatively 2-azidoethylamine, close the flask with a stopper and continue stirring at room temperature over night.\r\n\n\n9] Evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator.\r\n\n\n10] Dissolve the the residue in 1 mL of DCM and load it on the column \\(5g of Merck Silica gel 60, packed with DCM on a glass column). First use 200 mL DCM and then a stepwise gradient of methanol in DCM \\(from 1 to 10% methanol) to elute the compund. Collect fractions containing product and remove solvent under reduced pressure."
