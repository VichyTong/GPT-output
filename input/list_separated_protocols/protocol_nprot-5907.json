Step 1: Place tissue in 50 mL conical tube in 10 mL of Lysis Buffer with 100 ul proteinase K \\(1:100 dilution of a 20mg/ml).\r\n\n\n1.3. Step 2: Add “benchmark” controls to tube. \r\n\n\n1.4. Homogenize solution using the TissueMeiser, takes about 15-45 seconds depending on amount of tissue.\r\n\n\n1.5. Repeat for remaining samples.\r\n\n\nNOTE: Between every sample, sterilize TissueMeiser in water, followed by bleach, followed by 70% EtOH followed by PBS. Change water after every sample, other wash liquids can be used for 3-4 samples.\r\n\n\n1.6. Place tubes at 55C overnight. This can be done in a water bath or incubator."
