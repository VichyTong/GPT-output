    "\nIn this protocol we describe the live imaging of MVB-PM fusion using the CD63-pHluorin reporter in HeLa cells. The protocol can be applied to other adherent cells although basal fusion rates were found to vary between cell types. Furthermore, the transient transfection of other cells might require a different transfection protocol. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n",

Important: Note that during live TIRF microscopy of CD63-pHluorin transfected cells, sudden increases in fluorescent intensity can be detected that are not a consequence of full MVB-PM fusion and thus do not report exosome release. The two main causes for these sudden increases in fluorescence are \\(transport) vesicles with neutral pH that move into the TIRF field, and so-called kiss-and-run events, which result from transient pore formation between MVBs and the PM without full fusion. Fortunately, these events can be discriminated from full MVB-PM fusion by analysis of the fluorescent profile right before and following initial fusion \\(Figure 2 and 3a). Here we provide a set of guidelines for the analysis of CD63-pHluorin live imaging data:\r\n  \r\n\n\nA burst of fluorescence is typically considered as exosome release event when:\r\n\n\n- it has a peak intensity of ≥ 1.5-fold above background \\(fluorescence from the PM)\r\n\n\n- reaches peak intensity in a maximum of two frames \\[when imaging at 2Hz]\r\n\n\n- has a size of at least 400 nm\r\n\n\n- shows minimal movement after the initial burst \\(As a rule of thumb we do not count vesicles that move more than twice the diameter of the vesicle)\r\n\n\n- has a duration of ≥ 2 sec, i.e. visible in > 4 consecutive frames \\[when imaging at 2Hz]"

Kiss-and-run fusion events display a sudden increase in fluorescent intensity, but can be distinguished based on post-fusion movement and irregular decrease of fluorescent signal. Neutral vesicles can be observed during their approach to the PM, resulting in a slower increase in fluorescent intensity and can move in the TIRF field for prolonged time-periods."
