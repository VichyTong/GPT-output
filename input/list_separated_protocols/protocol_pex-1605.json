"\n<p>Transformation of spMSP plasmids into BL21 cells.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaw 1 vial of BL21 STAR<sup>TM</sup> (DE3) cells on ice.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 1 µL of spMSP plasmids (10-50 ng/ µL) into the vial and keep it on ice for 10 minutes.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds and place the vial on ice for 2 minutes.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 500 µL LB broth into the vial and shake it at 37 °C for 1 hour.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the cells on LB agar Kanamycin plates.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Expression of spMSPs in BL21 cells.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single colony from the plate was picked into 10 ml LB media supplemented with 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Shake the culture at 37 °C overnight (200 rpm).</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer the 10 ml culture into 1 L LB supplemented with 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Incubate the 1L culture at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.7.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add IPTG (0.2 mM) into the culture and continue incubation with shaking at 120 rpm for 20h at 16 °C.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect the cells by centrifugation at 3450 x g for 20 minutes using 5920 R.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;Purification of spMSPs.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8),100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) plus one cOmplete tablet.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cells were lysed on ice using a Branson cell disrupter (60% duty cycle, 45 secs).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12, 000 x g for 45 mins using JXN26.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supernatant was loaded onto a 1 ml Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column, followed by extensive wash (20 column volume) using buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20 mM Imidazole, 400 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were eluted in buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 500 mM Imidazole, 400 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol), desalted in buffer A using PD MiDiTrap G-25 (GE Healthcare), and stored at -80 °C.</p><p><br></p><p>\tNanodiscs reconstitution</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purified spMSPs were incubated with PC lipids at different ratios in buffer A containing 0.05% DDM. Samples were kept on ice for 30 min, and detergents were slowly removed with BioBeads (1/3 volume) and gentle shaking (4 °C, overnight).</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cNDs were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using the Superose 6 10/300 in buffer A. Fractions corresponding to cNDs were kept and subjected to analysis by negative stain electron microscopy.</p><p><br></p><p>Negative stain electron microscopy</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids were glow discharged (15 mA, 25 secs) using PELCO easiGlow<sup>TM</sup>.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cNDs (10 µg/ml) were applied onto the grids for 30 secs, followed by staining with 0.75% uranyl formate for 1 minute.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Images were collected using a ThermoFisher Science Tecnai G2 TEM (100 kV) equipped with a Veleta CCD camera (Olympus).</p>"
