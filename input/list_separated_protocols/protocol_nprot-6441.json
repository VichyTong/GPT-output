            "99........  For each aggregation-prone barnase variant, under each treatment condition, calculate the concentration \\(or Acceptor fluorescence intensity) at which there is 50% aggregation \\(_A<sub>50%</sub>_). If using, Excel and GraphPad Prism, proceed as per steps 100 – 107. For other software, the steps are described briefly here.\r\n\n\n........ i)........ The percent of cells with aggregates increases sigmoidally with log<sub>10</sub>\\(concentration). Therefore, the concentration at which 50% of cells have aggregates can be estimated by fitting to a sigmoidal curve. Extract log<sub>10</sub>\\(bin midpoint) and percent of cells with aggregates data from the Fitting_algorithm_aggregation.txt file \\(file layout described in step 100), and fit to a Boltzmann sigmoidal equation modified to have a minimum _y_-value of 0 and a maximum _y_-value of 100. Record the point of inflection as the _A<sub>50%</sub>_.\r\n\n\n........ ii)........  Test whether _A<sub>50%</sub>_ changes significantly between treatment and control conditions.\r\n\n\n........  .......A) If using all mutants, we recommend calculating Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ for each mutant by subtracting the average _A<sub>50%</sub>_ under the control condition from the average _A<sub>50%</sub>_ under each treatment condition. This will yield a single Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ value per mutant per treatment. Next, test whether Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ across all mutants is significantly different from zero using a non-parametric test. A positive Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ suggests that the treatment enables the cells to mitigate aggregation and therefore implies improved proteostasis. Conversely a negative Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ suggests impaired proteostasis.\r\n\n\n........  .......B) If using a single mutant, or small subset of mutants, analysis can be done by Student’s t-test or two-way ANOVA, respectively. An increase in _A<sub>50%</sub>_ upon treatment suggests that the treatment enables the cells to mitigate aggregation and therefore implies improved proteostasis. Conversely a decrease in _A<sub>50%</sub>_ suggests impaired proteostasis.\r\n\n\n100........  _Import aggregation data._ Open new Microsoft Office Excel document.

If the curves do not fit the data, or fail to fit within the iteration limit, it may be necessary to optimize the initial values and/or constraints. \r\n\n\n105........  _Transfer _A<sub>50%</sub>_ data from Prism to Excel._ In the folders pane in Prism, select the “Nonlin fit of Data 1” file.

For each non-excluded mutant, under each treatment, calculate the average _A<sub>50%</sub>_ of all replicates. Next, subtract the average _A<sub>50%</sub>_ under control conditions from the average _A<sub>50%</sub>_ under each treatment condition, for each mutant \\(i.e. for each mutant, Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ = average _A<sub>50%</sub>_ treatment – average _A<sub>50%</sub>_ control). \r\n\n\nNote: if all 15 mutants were used, then there will be 12 “replicate” Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ values for each treatment, corresponding to 12 mutants \\(15 mutants, excluding wild type, V45T and I55G).\r\n\n\n........  .......ii)........ _Transfer_ Δ _A<sub>50%</sub> data to Prism_. Copy Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ values from Excel. Open a new Column Graph table in Prism. Label each column with the treatment condition.

In the Analysis pane, select “= Analyse”. Expand the “Column analyses” option and select “Column statistics”. In the “Analyze which data sets?”, ensure all treatment conditions are selected. Press Ok. Under “Inferences” select “Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Compare column medians to a hypothetical value” and press OK. \r\n\n\nNote: Instructions are given for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, however you can use a non-parametric test of your choosing. Test investigates whether the Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ is significantly different to 0 \\(null hypothesis: no change in _A<sub>50%</sub>_ due to treatment)\r\n\n\n........  .......iv)........ _Data output analysis._ Use the folders pane to view your analysed data. The file generated in the Graph folder will demonstrate your data as a column graph. The _x_-axis will display the treatment condition and the _y_-axis will display the Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_. The file generated in the Results folder will provide the output of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. A negative _A<sub>50%</sub>_ means that the _A<sub>50%</sub>_ is lower under treatment conditions than control conditions, and therefore that the treatment causes barnase to aggregate at a lower concentration. This is associated with proteostasis impairment. Conversely, a positive Δ _A<sub>50%</sub>_ is associated with enhanced proteostasis capacity\r\n\n\n........ B)........  If using a single mutant, or small subset of mutants, analysis can be done using Student’s t-test or two-way ANOVA, respectively. A description is given for two-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism.\r\n\n\n........  .......i)........ _Transfer A<sub>50%</sub> data to Prism._ In GraphPad Prism, create a new data table and graph, selecting the Grouped Data option, with three replicate values. Enter the calculated _A<sub>50%</sub>_ values into the data table, with barnase mutants as rows and treatment and control conditions as columns. \r\n\n\n........  .......ii)........ _Perform two-way ANOVA._ In the Analysis pane, select “= Analyse”. Expand the “Grouped analyses” option and select “Two-way ANOVA”. Select “no matching” and enter “treatment” as the column variable and “barnase variant” as the row variable. Press OK.\r\n\n\n........  .......iii)........ _Data output analysis._ The file generated in the Results folder will provide the output of the Two-way ANOVA. The p-value of the column factor \\(treatment) reports on the difference between treated and control conditions. A significant increase in _A<sub>50%</sub>_ upon treatment suggests that the treatment enables the cells to mitigate aggregation and therefore implies improved proteostasis.
