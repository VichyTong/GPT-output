Quantification, Normalization and Pooling</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A. cpn60 amplicon PCR</strong>:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Prepare primer cocktail (1:3 molar ratio).&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred microliters primer cocktail is sufficient to amplify 300 samples.</p><p>\t3 µL M279 (100 µM)</p><p>\t3 µL M280 (100 µM)</p><p>\t9 µL M1612 (100 µM)</p><p>\t9 µL M1613 (100 µM)</p><p>\t276 µL ultrapure water</p><p>\t(Total volume 300 µL)</p><p><br></p><p>2. Prepare PCR master mix considering one PCR reaction per sample. When calculating the number of samples, include no template control (PCR control), extraction controls (reagent control for DNA extractions) and the positive control.</p><p>\tPer reaction (assuming 2 µL template volume):</p><p>\t38.1 µL ultrapure water</p><p>\t5 µL 10x PCR buffer</p><p>\t2.5 µL MgCl2 (50 mM)</p><p>\t0.4 µL Platinum Taq Polymerase</p><p>\t1 µL dNTP mix (10 mM)</p><p>\t1 µL primer cocktail</p><p><br></p><p>3. Dispense 48 µl of master mix into the required number of wells of 96-well PCR plate. Add 2 µL template DNA.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Seal the PCR plate with foil and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature.</p><p>5. Place the sealed PCR plate into the thermocycler.</p><p>6. Amplify the cpn60 library following the cpn60 PCR program in a thermocycler:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\t5 min at&nbsp;95&nbsp;°C&nbsp;</p><p>\t40 cycles of (30 sec at 95&nbsp;°C, 30 sec at 60&nbsp;°C, 30 sec at 72&nbsp;°C)</p><p>\t2 min at 72&nbsp;°C</p><p><br></p><p>7.&nbsp;Evaluate the cpn60 PCR products by running the no template control and the positive control amplicons in a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualize using an imaging system. If there is a ~680 bp amplicon observed in the positive control and no amplification in the no template control (Fig. 1), proceed to amplicon clean-up step or store the amplicon PCR plate at 4&nbsp;°C&nbsp;and proceed to PCR clean up the next day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>B. cpn60 PCR clean-up</strong>:&nbsp;</p><p><em>This step is carried out to remove primer-dimers and un-incorporated dNTPs and primers.&nbsp;</em></p><p>1. Bring the amplicon PCR plate and the NucleoMag beads to room temperature.</p><p>2. Centrifuge the amplicon PCR plate at 1000 x g at room temperature for 1 minute and remove the plate seal very carefully.</p><p>3. Transfer 50 µl of PCR product from the amplicon PCR plate to the deepwell plate using a multi-channel pipettor.</p><p>4. Calculate the total volume of NucleoMag beads needed (32.5 µl per sample).</p><p>5. Vortex NucleoMag beads for 1 minute to resuspend, and aliquot the required total volume of NucleoMag beads to a reagent reservoir.</p><p>6. Add 32.5 µl of NucleoMag beads to each well of the deepwell plate using a multi-channel pipette, changing tips after each transfer to prevent cross-contamination between samples.</p><p>7. Seal the deepwell plate with a foil sealer and shake it in the plate-shaker at 1800 rpm for 2 minutes. (If a plate-shaker is not available, pipetting up and down 10 times using a multi-channel pipet is an alternative method for mixing)</p><p>8. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 5 minutes.</p><p>9. Put the deepwell plate on the magnetic stand for 2 minutes until the supernatant is clear.&nbsp;</p><p>10. Using a multi-channel pipette, remove the supernatant while the PCR clean-up plate is sitting on the magnet. Change the tips in between the samples. If the beads get disturbed during the pipetting process, wait until they re-settle. Never throw away beads.</p><p>11. Add sufficient volume of freshly prepared 80% ethanol (200 µl/well) to a reagent reservoir.</p><p>12. While the plate is sitting on the magnet, add 200µl of ethanol to each well of the PCR clean-up plate using a multi-channel pipette.</p><p>13. Incubate the PCR clean-up plate on the magnetic stand for 30 seconds.</p><p>14. While the PCR clean-up plate is still sitting on the magnet, remove the supernatant very carefully using a mutichannel pipette.</p><p>15. Perform a second wash by repeating steps 12-14.</p><p>16. Using a P20 tip, remove all the residual ethanol while the PCR clean-up plate is sitting on the magnet. Change tips between wells.</p><p>17. Leave the PCR-clean up plate on the magnet for 10 minutes to dry the beads.</p><p>18. Add sufficient volume of 10 mM Tris pH 8.5 to a reagent reservoir (52.5 µL/well).</p><p>19. Elute the amplicon DNA from the beads by removing the PCR clean-up plate from the magnet and adding 52.5 µl of 10mM Tris pH 8.5 to each well using a multi-channel pipette.</p><p>20. Seal the PCR clean-up plate using a foil plate sealer.</p><p>21. Shake the PCR clean-up plate using the plate shaker at 1800 rpm for 2 minutes. (If a plate-shaker is not available, pipetting up and down 10 times using a multi-channel pipet is an alternative method for mixing).</p><p>22. Incubate the PCR clean-up plate at room temperature for 2 minutes.</p><p>23. Return the PCR clean-up plate to the magnet for 2 minutes until the supernatant is clear.</p><p>24. Label a new PCR plate as “NucleoMag bead cleaned cpn60 amplicon”.</p><p>25. While the PCR clean-up plate is sitting on the magnet, use a multi-channel pipette to transfer 50 µl of supernatant from each well to the newly labelled plate. Change the tips in between the samples. If the beads get disturbed during the pipetting process, wait until they settle.&nbsp;</p><p>26. Evaluate the cpn60 amplicons by running a randomly selected subset of NucleoMag cleaned amplicons in a 1% agarose gel. If there is a ~680 bp amplicon observed in the samples with the absence of primer dimers (Fig. 2), proceed to the index PCR step or store the plate at -20&nbsp;°C&nbsp;for up to 1 week.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>C.
