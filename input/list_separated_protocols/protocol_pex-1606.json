    "\n<p>Our approach is to recreate as closely as possible the initial and boundary conditions, physical and biochemical, in the embryo at the onset of neural tube development. The nervous system develops from the anterior epiblast, a pluripotent epithelium overlaying the endoderm, and is in contact with a lumen -the amnion. Neural development is triggered by a combination of NODAL and BMP signaling from surrounding tissues<sup>7,8</sup>. Inspired by these events, we used micropatterning of stem cells<sup>9–11</sup>&nbsp;to create a pluripotent epithelium with controlled and reproducible dimensions (Fig. 1, Day",

We first apply PLL-PEG to passivate the surface, while protecting regions of interest using a PDMS stencil (Fig."

For this purpose we apply Matrigel, which has been previously used to generate lumens from small hPSC colonies<sup>14</sup> and in brain organoids<sup>2</sup>. We find that exposure of 2D hPSC cultures to low percentage Matrigel results in robust lumen formation. This occurs through folding of the 2D hPSC culture, and maintains the epithelial structure of the culture. Thus, the initial epithelial state of the culture is essential for the formation of a single lumen. This is in contrast to Matrigel embedding of brain organoids<sup>2</sup> in which the cell aggregate lacks epithelial organization prior to Matrigel exposure, and exposure to Matrigel results in the formation of multiple lumens. Another key point is the media in which Matrigel is diluted. Here we describe addition of Matrigel diluted in neural induction media, which is optimized for the neural tube morphogenesis protocol. However, to maintain the pluripotency of the culture during the transition to 3D, one should dilute Matrigel in mTESR. This allows further differentiation into mesendoderm cell types.</p><p><br></p><p>1.     Prepare neural induction media (N2).

The approach is based on exposure to BMP4, which is known to pattern the ectoderm into neural and non-neural domains in a concentration dependent manner<sup>8</sup>. A similar approach has been used in 2D stem cell cultures to drive pattern formation, however folding morphogenesis was not observed<sup>9–11</sup>. Thus, the presence of a 3D stem cell culture, and a lumen, are essential for folding morphogenesis. The timing of BMP addition is critical, and we find that a minimal neural induction period of three days is required before adding BMP. Adding BMP earlier than that results in mesendoderm fates and does not lead to folding morphogenesis. </p><p><br></p><p>1.     Media change (Day 4).</p><p>a.     Check for lumen formation in brightfield.
