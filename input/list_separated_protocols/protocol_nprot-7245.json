After DAPI staining, the coverslips are washed 3 times with PBS. Optimizing DAPI concentration and incubation time for different cell lines, as well as terminating the DNA staining by multiple PBS washes, facilitate quantitative image-based cell cycle staging, so that total DAPI intensities scale with DNA content correspondingly and allow for a discrimination of the different cell cycle phases \\(see Troubleshooting section)."

Incubate at 50-60 °C for 10 minutes to resolve all components. Repeat until all components are dissolved. Prepare aliquots and store at -20° C.

The choice of objective and number of acquired images per condition depend on cell density, desired read-out, required image resolution and camera field of view. Besides dedicated high content platforms \\(e.g. Olympus ScanR, Thermo Scientific CellomicsArrayScan, Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra/Micro, GE Healthcare IN Cell Analyzer 6000/2200, Perkin Elmer Opera/Operetta, BD Biosciences BD Pathway 855/435) images acquired with any automated fluorescence microscope, wide-field or confocal, as well as manually acquired images can be subjected to quantitative image-based cytometry analyses \\(see Troubleshooting section)."

Here, total DAPI levels, and mean intensities of EdU, γH2AX, poly\\(ADP-ribose), PARP1, PARP2, Histone H3 phospho S10 and Cyclin A are measured. For RAD51, BRCA1 and 53BP1 foci segmentation and quantification in high-resolution images an integrated spot-detection module is used. Various commercial software packages and open-source alternatives \\(e.g. ImageJ/Fiji, CellProfiler) can be used for image segmentation and feature extraction \\(see Troubleshooting section)."

Spotfire is used to generate color-coded scatter plots of asynchronous cell populations in a flow-cytometry-like fashion and to quantify percentages and cell \\(sub)population averages. Fluorescence intensities are depicted as arbitrary units. For visualizing discrete data in scatter plots \\(e.g. foci numbers), mild jittering \\(random displacement of data points along the discrete data axes) is applied in order to demerge overlapping data points. Within one experiment, similar cell numbers are compared for the different conditions. The free software environment for statistical computing and graphics R can be used as an alternative for data visualization and analysis."
