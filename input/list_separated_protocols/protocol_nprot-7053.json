Set a 60 μl PCR reaction as follows:\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7211/original/Table_6_-_PCR_mix.png?1537570398\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7211/thumbnail/Table_6_-_PCR_mix.png?1537570398\" > </a> \r\n\n\n*Not added as a mix\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n104. Split the mixture into 6 tubes and run with the following protocol:\r\n  2 min x 94 °C\r\n\n\n45 sec x 94 °C\r\n\n\n85 sec x 50 °C\r\n\n\n60 sec x 72 °C\r\n\n\n4 °C…\r\n\n\n105. Remove a tube from the PCR cycler to ice after 9,11,13,15,17,19 cycles.\r\n  106. Load the entire tubes content on a 2.5% agarose gel and run for 1 hour. Select the optimal #cycles.\r\n  107. Setup an identical PCR mixture at a volume of 300 μl, and run the PCR for the optimal number of cycles \\(split to 3 tubes with 100 μl each). \r\n  108. Concentrate the PCR product by ZYMO PCR purification kit to 70 μl.\r\n  109. Size-select 30 μl of the library using PipenPrep to deplete the residual primers and adapter-adapter products based on the following expected sizes: Linker-Linker - 126bp, 20-40 nt footprint libraries: 146-166 bp, 40-80 nt footprint libraries: 166-196 bp."
