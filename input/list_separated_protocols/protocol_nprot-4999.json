    "\nPROCEDURE\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nReagent Preparation\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSodium Phosphate Buffer \\(25mM, pH 7.0)\r\n\n\nSeparate solutions of disodium hydrogen phosphate in 100ml deionized water \\(25mM, by dissolving 0.445g) and sodium hydrogen phosphate monobasic in 100ml deionized water \\(25mM, by dissolving 0.39gm) are made and then pH 7.0 is maintained by adding two solutions slowly and measuring it by pH meter.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRNO Preparation \\(100 µM)\r\n\n\nIt is prepared by dissolving 0.15 mg in 10ml of 25mM sodium phosphate buffer. Wrap the bottle containing RNO solution with aluminium foil. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nL-Histidine \\(12.5mM)\r\n\n\nDissolve 48.5mg in 25 ml of 25mM sodium phosphate buffer.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSodium hypochlorite \\(100mM)\r\n\n\nCommercially available sodium hypochlorite \\(Sigma) has molarity of 0.7M. We use 100mM, so add 28.5µl in the 200µl reaction system.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHydrogen Peroxide \\(100mM)\r\n\n\nCommercially available H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has 9.7Molarity. We prepare 1M stock solution from which we add 20µl for 200µl reaction mixture.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSample Preparation\r\n\n\nPositive control \\(Rose Bengal) and negative control \\(DABCO) is prepared in deionized water likewise other samples either a crude extract from plant, cell, tissue, pure samples can be prepared in their respective solvent i.e. DMSO, ethanol or water. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMethodology",
