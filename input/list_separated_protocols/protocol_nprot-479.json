Resuspend the ES cells in 10 ml fresh ES medium by thoroughly pipetting them up and down. Good dissociation of the cells is important, the goal being to obtain single-cell culture or aggregates of 2–3 cells. Larger cell clumps should not remain.\r\n\n\n4 Passage 5% of the ES cell suspension for 3 days of culture or 2% for 4 days to fresh 20–30 ml of ES medium in a new gelatin-coated flask."
