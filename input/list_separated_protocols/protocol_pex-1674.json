Sterile filter with a 0.22 mm vacuum filtration bottle and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare the required volume of ALI maintenance medium by adjusting the above volumes accordingly.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Prepare aliquots of ALI media to avoid repeated warming and cooling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Thawing Cryopreserved Cells</u></strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm Pneumacult Ex-Plus growth medium to 37 °C and prepare materials prior to obtaining a vial of cells from cryostorage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove vial from liquid nitrogen (wearing eye protection) and thaw in 37 °C water bath (1-2 min).</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that cells are thawed quickly to reduce the duration of exposure to the high concentration of DMSO in the freezing medium, which will negatively impact cell viability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 24 mL of growth medium to a 50 mL conical tube then transfer the thawed cells from the cryovial into the growth medium using a P1000 pipette and gently mix by inverting 10 times.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> do not vortex</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pellet cells via centrifugation at 1,000 x <em>g</em> for 4 minutes at room temperature in centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully aspirate the supernatant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently resuspend the cells in pre-warmed growth medium and transfer to a flask.&nbsp;Distribute cell suspension on the dish through a combination of gentle rocking and swirling of the dish for approximately 15 seconds. &nbsp;Some investigators prefer to thaw cells into a collagen coated vessel, although this is not necessary.&nbsp;All subsequent passages use non-coated vessels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If a vial containing 1.0x10<sup>6</sup> cells is thawed, then the cells should be plated in a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place in a tissue culture incubator overnight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check cells the following day for attachment to the dish.&nbsp;Aspirate and replace medium.</p><p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Passaging and Expansion of pHBEC</u></strong></p><p>It is recommended to passage the cells when they are &gt;50-70% confluent.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-warm Pneumacult ALI growth medium and DPBS in a 37 °C water bath and a trypsin aliquot at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate growth medium from flasks to be passaged.&nbsp;Cells may be rinsed once with DPBS but this is not required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add trypsin-EDTA solution and place in a tissue culture incubator for 2-3 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500 mL/well of 12 well plate.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.0 mL/T75 flask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approximately 80-90% of the cells are detached (which can be facilitated by tapping sides and bottom of the flask), add a half volume of SBTI to the flask, pipet up the trypsin/SBTI mixture, and rinse the vessel bottom. This aids mixing of the trypsin and SBTI, and helps remove remaining adherent cells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer the cells to a sterile centrifuge tube.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Cells from the same donor source plated over individual wells or flasks can be combined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pellet cells at 200-600 x <em>g</em> for 5 minutes at room temperature in a centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the supernatant.&nbsp;Note the size of the cell pellet before tapping the tube to break up the pellet.&nbsp;Ideally, the pellet should be resuspended in a volume of medium that will yield a cell density of 1.0x10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL. Triturate the cells with a serological pipet to create a homogeneous suspension.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> With experience, you will be able to judge this volume based on the pellet size.&nbsp;For a barely visible pellet, start with 1 mL medium; for a pellet of 1 cm, start with 10ml medium (generally, resuspension volumes will range from 5-10 mL).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer a 10 mL aliquot of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the cells.&nbsp;Viability can be determined, if desired, by diluting a sample of the cells with an equal volume of trypan blue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust the number of cells to approximately 1.0x10<sup>6</sup>/mL.&nbsp;If the cell density is less than 1.0x10<sup>6</sup>/mL, re-pellet the cells and suspend in the appropriate volume.&nbsp;If the cells density is greater than 1.0x10<sup>6</sup>/mL, dilute the cell suspension with the appropriate volume of medium.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>10. Plating density will be based on how quickly you want the cells to be ready for subsequent passage/plating.&nbsp;Cells are typically seeded at 0.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> but can be seeded more heavily if desired.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>11. Change the medium every other day until cells reach approximately 70% confluence.&nbsp;Denser cultures may require more frequent medium replacement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12. Upon approaching confluence cells can be:</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passaged further for culture (seeding densities and volumes in table below)</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plated on Transwell inserts for ALI differentiation (seeding densities and volumes in table below)</p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryopreserved (procedure described below</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Refer to Tables 1A and B for Suggested Cell Seeding Densities/Volumes in Flasks and Multi-Well Plates.</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cells should be used at 90-100% confluence for experiments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Differentiation of pHBEC Cultures at ALI</u></strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trypsinize and collect cells from expansion flasks as described in steps #1-9 of the “Passaging and Expansion of pHBEC” section above.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with a cell density of 1.0x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, prepare a volume and dilution of cell suspension according to the size and number of Transwell inserts needed based on the seeding density and volume table below.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Prepare a volume of diluted cell suspension that is greater than the exact amount needed for the desired plating to account for volume loss and/or slight variations in pipetting.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;If seeding 12 24mm inserts at 3.0x10<sup>5 </sup>cells per insert then prepare sufficient cell suspension for seeding 14 inserts to allow for volume lost during handling.</p><p>14 x 0.75 ml = 10.5 mL final volume.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>14 inserts x 3.0x10<sup>5 </sup>cells/insert = 4.2x10<sup>6 </sup>cells needed</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If your cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1.0x10<sup>6</sup>/mL, then you would add 4.2 mL of the cell suspension to 6.3 mL of additional medium to get the desired plating density (3.0x10<sup>5</sup>/0.75 mL added to each insert).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow cells to adhere to Transwell inserts for 16-24 hours. After the adhesion period, aspirate medium to remove nonadherent cells and add fresh Pneumacult Ex-Plus growth medium in the apical compartment.&nbsp;Continue to grow in Pneumacult Ex-Plus growth medium until the cells are confluent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once cells are confluent, withdraw the apical medium and replace the basolateral medium with Pneumacult ALI differentiation medium.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace the Pneumacult ALI differentiation medium in the basolateral compartment every 48 hours.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Cilia will become visible in as little as 7 days. &nbsp;Cells will continue to differentiate and the majority of culture surface will become ciliated.&nbsp;Washing the apical surface with DPBS at least once per week is recommended.</p><p>Determine the number of inserts to be seeded and adjust cell density and volume as outlined in the table below. STEMCELL recommends 0.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;We have seen the best results with cells seeded on the membranes at passage 2 and 3, but we have obtained highly ciliated cultures from differention of passage 5 cells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Refer to Table 2 for Suggested Cell Seeding Densities/Volumes for Corning Transwell Inserts.</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Cryopreservation of pHBEC</u></strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trypsinize and collect cells from expansion flasks as described in steps #1-8 of the “Passaging and Expansion of pHBEC” section above.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pellet cells again at 200-600 x <em>g</em> for 4 minutes at room temperature in centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuspend the pellet in CryStor10 Freezing Medium at a minimum of 1.0x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently mix by pipetting.&nbsp;Transfer 1.0 mL of the cell suspension to each cryovial.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place cryovials in a Mr. Frosty freezing container (filled to indicated line with isopropyl alcohol) and place in a -80 °C freezer overnight.&nbsp;</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>NOTE:</strong> Isopropanol should be changed after every three freezing cycles.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not leave vials at -80 °C longer than overnight as it will impact viability after thawing.</p><p>Transfer the frozen vials in liquid nitrogen storage.</p>"
