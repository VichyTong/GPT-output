This, however, is not always going to be possible given that certain tissue types do not homogenize well \\(i.e. skin).  Furthermore, appropriate control tissue does not always exist \\(i.e. tumor or xenograft tissue), and it may not always be possible to obtain control tissue from the same animal species.  In these situations, we have found that rat liver tissue can be used as an effective surrogate.  While the use of surrogate tissue can mimic the ion suppression and extraction from the tissue being quantified, the potential for unforeseen isobaric species in either the model or the target sample tissue should be noted.  If an isobar exists in the sample tissue and not in the model tissue, the limit of detection can be underestimated and vice versa for the inverse situation.  When preparing the tissue homogenate for the mimetic model, the use of a bead homogenizer without the addition of solvent is critical to yield a more morphologically relevant homogenate.<sup>8, 11</sup>",

It is also possible to add multiple standards to the same mimetic model to allow for the quantification of multiple species.  If the model is to contain multiple standards, their concentration gradients should be inverted such that the highest concentration of standard A should be spiked into the same homogenate as the lowest concentration of standard B.
