This takes you to a page that helps you combine various fields in the searches: http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/search/en/structuredSearch.jsf \r\n\n\nOn the left, through drop down lists, it is possible to change the default fields shown. This makes it possible to combine same or different fields. Also it is possible to combine the fields through either Boolean operators AND /OR. Again make sure that only the PCT option is selected, rather than national collections.

Select the field \"International Class\" and insert the codes identified previously, like C12N-15/90 \\(note this format is somewhat different from ECLA code shown in an earlier example when searching esp@cenet). You can combine that with \"plant\" in the claim field:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n• Keyword\\(s) in \"International Class\": C12N-15/90\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in \"English claims\": plant?\r\n\n\n 29 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n• Keyword\\(s) in \"International Class\": C12N-15/82\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in \"English claims\": plant?\r\n\n\n 2,526 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe records will most likely cover some means of integrating DNA into the chromosome – and combining it with “plant” in claims would mean all of these include the word “plant” in at least one of the claims."
