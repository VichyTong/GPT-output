    "\n<p><strong>2. Asthma</strong></p><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory system with breathlessness, airway hyper-responsiveness, recurrent cough and wheezing (1). Airway inflammation of asthmatic patients is dominantly eosinophillic inflammation. Asthmatic patients often have a family history of the allergic disease (9). Asthma is significantly associated with quality of life, anti-asthmatic drugs and Healthcare costs. In 2007 in the USA, for asthma treatment, the annual direct medical expenditure was 37.2 billion dollars [10-12]. Animal models using has largely contributed to the study of asthma, lungs diseases and development of new drugs. Rats, quina pig, pet cats and other animal can be used as model but handling of mice is easy. Mouse model has been used for identification of immunological alterations of inflammatory diseases and asthma (1). </p><p><strong><em>2.1. Acute ovalbumin allergic asthma model</em></strong></p><p>A common protocol of allergic asthma modeling is the ovalbumin (OVA) model in mice (9). Ovalbumin is used for asthma and airway inflammation model induction. For design of model, there are two stages sensitization and challenge. In the sensitization stage, 20 μg of OVA with 50 μl aluminum hydroxide (alum adjvant) are solute in PBS (last volume would be 100 μl) then injected intraperitoneal (IP) on day 0 and",
