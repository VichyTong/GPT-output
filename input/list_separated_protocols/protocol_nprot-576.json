In addition, embryos injected with Human Globin MO \\(HG-MO) serve as negative controls to demonstrate that developmental hindrance is not an artifact of microinjection. In each experiment, uninjected embryos and embryos injected with HG-MO were tested in parallel with Oct4-MO-mediated knockdown.  HG-MO was designed to specifically target a mutant human globin gene promoter, which would not be present in the mouse genome \\(Gene-Tools, Inc.).  We had tested this HG-MO when establishing our methods and found that its presence did not affect blastocyst developmental rates. Of note, genes that were previously validated to be differentially-expressed between uninjected and Oct4-MO-injected embryos were also confirmed to show no differential expression between uninjected and HG-MO-injected embryos",

Use of a Hoffman microscope with phase-contrast objectives and 40x magnification facilitates both the visual differentiation between an embryo and an oocyte, and the identification of pronuclei so they can be avoided during delivery of the MO into the cytoplasm. An anti-vibration platform \\(Visitek) placed directly under the microscope minimizes the possibility of trauma caused by a large puncture wound from a trembling needle. Tears from an unsteady needle can cause major damage to the embryo and may be the reason for the developmental arrest in some samples. Two micromanipulators attached to the microscope, one for holding and the other for injecting the embryo, move the glass pipettes in 3 different planes and are driven electrically and manually. Electrical control ensures fast coarse movement \\(bringing the needle/holding pipette into the microinjection drop), while the manual manipulator is used for the finer movements necessary to move and microinject embryos. Negative suction is controlled on the holding side by an Eppendorf Oil Tram, which creates negative/positive suction on the holding pipette.
