    "\n<p><strong>Serum sample collection. TIMING ~ 50 min for 60 samples</strong></p><p>1. Collecting leftover serum samples after their clinical tests at clinical lab of the hospital.</p><p>3. Storage: each serum sample was divided into 3 aliquots in 1.5 mL EP tubes and store at -80℃. Serum can be stored at -80℃ for more than one year without affecting monosaccharide compositions.</p><p><strong>Acidolysis. TIMING 24 h for up to 72 samples</strong></p><p>4. Serum samples are thawed on ice and 10 μL serum sample is transferred into 2 mL ampoule.</p><p>5. Add 10 μL Rha (1 mg/mL) and 1 mL TFA (2M) into each ampoule. </p><p>6. Use Oil bath to conduct acidolysis, which takes 6 h. Transfer the sample to 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and dry it in centrifugal concentrator</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Problem: </strong>Extra residues in hydrolyzed serum samples. </p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Solution:</strong> Add 200 μL of chromatographic methanol and then vortex. After fully mixed, concentrate and dry, repeat three times to obtain the cleaner hydrolyzed samples.</p><p><strong>Sample derivatization. TIMING 90 min for up to 72 samples</strong></p><p>7. Add 40 μL NaOH (0.3M) and 60 μL PMP (0.5M) into each sample. Vortex for 5 s and centrifuge for another 10 s.</p><p><strong>CRITICAL STEP </strong>At this point, the 0.3M NaOH offer the basic environment required for PMP derivation. The proper derivative pH is between 11-13.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Problem:</strong> PMP-derivatives show brown color.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Solution:</strong> The preparation of 0.3 M NaOH should be careful. Excessive alkali produces the colored byproducts.</p><p>8. PMP derivatization reaction is conducted at 70℃ in a water bath for 90 minutes, then neutralize with hydrochloric acid.</p><p><strong>CRITICAL STEP </strong>In alkaline conditions, non-reactive PMP will exist in the form of salt in the system, which will reduce the efficiency of subsequent extraction, and lead to an increasing background for HPLC analysis.</p><p>9. Add 500 μL CHCl<sub>3</sub> into each sample tube, and vortex for 5 s.</p><p>10. Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 g/min and transfer the supernatant to HPLC vials. </p><p><strong>PAUSE POINT</strong> The PMP-labeled monosaccharides can be stored at 4 ℃ and analyzed within 3 days.</p><p><strong>Monosaccharide standard derivatization. </strong></p><p>11. Preparation of monosaccharide standards: Firstly, dilute the stock solution of Man，GlcN，GalN，GlcUA，Glc，Gal， Xyl，Fuc, Rha to 1.0 mg/mL. Then mix the 9 monosaccharide standards together and dilute 2 times. The final range of working standard solution is 0.5 mg/mL to 0.0005 mg/mL.</p><p>12. Add 40 μL 0.3 M NaOH into each standard mixture to adjust pH to 12-13, and add 60 μL 0.5 M PMP for monosaccharide labeling as described in Steps 7 to 10.</p><p><strong>HPLC analysis. TIMING~20 min per sample</strong></p><p>13. Tuning of the LC system. Assure that the LC is working appropriately according to the manufacturers’ recommendations or the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the respective laboratory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>14. Set up the HPLC system to separate PMP-labeled monosaccharides as described under <strong>EQUIPMENT SETUP</strong>.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Problem:</strong> High background; No signal; Weak signal or impurity peaks.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Solution:</strong> The extraction conditions described in Steps 9-10 need to be followed, a high background is usually caused by leftover PMP in samples; ensure that the LC-MS system is working properly and the wavelength of DAD is set at 254 nm; Check pH value of Step",
