"\n<p><em>Preparing PVA-based HSC media:</em></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media should be prepared fresh for every use and media should be pre-warmed to 37°C before use.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix media reagents to make F12 media supplemented with 10mM HEPES, 1X P/S/G, 1X ITSX, 1 mg/ml PVA, 100 ng/ml TPO, and 10 ng/ml SCF. Prepare enough for 200 ul per well. Note that PVA solution is viscous and will need to be pipetted slowly. Mix media well by inversion before use.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer 200 ul media into desired 96-well plate wells (or 1 ml media for 24-well plate wells). Fill remaining plate wells with PBS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Isolating c-Kit+ cells from mouse bone marrow:</em></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count mouse bone marrow cells and spin down at 440 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes at 4°C.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuspend cells in 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in PBS and add anti-c-Kit Microbeads at a ratio of 20 ul per 10<sup>7 </sup>cells.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix and incubate at 4°C for 15 minutes, then add 10 ml of PBS and spin down at 440 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes at 4°C.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuspend in 2 ml PBS and perform magnetic column enrichment using LS columns, according to the manufacturers’ protocol.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count the retrieved c-Kit-enriched cells by transferring 10 ul of the cells to a tube, mixing 1:1 with Trypan Blue and count using a hemocytometer.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin down cells at 440 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes at 4°C and resuspend in at 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Seed 1 ml per 48-well plate well.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill any unused wells with PBS and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 20% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Maintaining HSPC cultures:</em></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media changes must be performed every 2-3 days throughout the entire culture using pre-warmed and freshly-prepared media. Inspect the cell cultures before performing each media change using a light microscope.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect all the cell culture media in the well into a 15 ml tube using a pipette.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin down at 440 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes at RT. After removing supernatants, add new media and resuspend in at ~1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Seed 1 ml per well in 48-well plate.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After media changes, transfer back to the tissue culture incubator.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once wells exhibit 80-90% confluency, cell cultures can be passaged at a ratio of 1:2-1:3.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cells cultures can be analyzed at any time point as described below. Alternatively, cell cultures can be used in <em>in vivo</em> transplantation assays (see other published protocols on the HSC transplantation assay) (4,7,8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Analyzing HSPC cultures:</em></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To count the cell cultures, gently pipette the cultures to dissociate attached cells. Transfer 10 ul of the culture to a tube. Mix 1:1 with Trypan Blue and count using a hemocytometer. Alternatively, an automated cell counter can be used.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To analyze by flow cytometry, cells should be first stained with Sca1, cKit, and Lineage antibodies: Dissociate attached cells by gently pipetting the media over the plate bottom. Transfer cells to a tube and spin down at 1500 rpm (440 <em>g</em>) for 5 minutes.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuspend cells in PBS containing the antibodies against CD150, c-Kit, Sca-1, CD4, CD8, CD45R/B220, Ter119, Ly6G/Ly6C, CD127, and CD11b. Stain cells at 4°C for 30 minutes, wash with at least 10 volumes of PBS and spin down.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuspend cells in ~200 ul PBS containing 1X PI, transfer to a FACS tube, and store at 4°C until analysis.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyze on a FACS machine/flow cytometer using unstained and single stained samples as controls, and quantify the frequency of CD150<sup>+</sup>Kit<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>Lineage<sup>-</sup> live cell population.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
