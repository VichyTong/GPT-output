Put the other lobes into the original plastic bottle and the bottle into the icebox. Put the central lobe into another 50 mL tube.\r\n  For liver, be careful to determine the central lobe. Normally, rat tissue central lobe has two big pieces not totally separated. Check the anatomy textbook if not sure about that."

Use spatula to make sure that tissue is already minced totally and no big piece left.\r\n  • To obtain correct exposure time for method developing, start with slow speed setting for about 15 seconds.\r\n\n\n• For minimum sizes, samples must always be submersed up to the first slot in the probe generator so that the bearing is lubricated.\r\n\n\n• Treatment is generally more effective on concentrated samples.\r\n\n\n• When large volume is applied, the effectiveness of the homogenizer can be greatly increased by use of a square tube \\(such as Brinckmann Cat. No. 27 11 851-0)."
