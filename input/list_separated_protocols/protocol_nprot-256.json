Rad51 was found to promote formation of joint molecules \\(D-loops) \\(Fig. 1a)<sup>4</sup>. RPA, a ubiquitous ssDNA-binding protein, was included because of its important role in DSB repair _in vivo_, where it interacts with ssDNA-intermediates and DNA repair proteins<sup>9</sup>. DNA polymerase η was used for extension of the invading DNA because recent data implicated it in recombinational repair of DSB \\(Fig. 1b)<sup>10</sup>. Rad54 protein was used for dissociation of extended joint molecules, in accord with our recent data \\(Fig. 1c)<sup>3</sup>. Rad52 was expected to promote annealing of the tailed DNA displaced from the D-loop with the complementary tailed DNA, which represented the second end of broken DNA \\(Fig. 1d)<sup>11</sup>. This set of proteins defines the minimal DSBs repair reconstitution system."
